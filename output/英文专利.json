In general, the transgenic plants are characterized by particular advantageous properties, for example by resistances to certain active ingredients used in the agrochemical industry, in particular certain herbicides, resistances to plant diseases or pathogens of plant diseases, such as certain insects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. Other specific characteristics relate, for example, to the harvested material with regard to quantity, quality, storability, composition and specific constituents. For instance, there are known transgenic plants with an elevated starch content or altered starch quality, or those with a different fatty acid composition in the harvested material. Further particular properties lie in tolerance or resistance to abiotic stress factors, for example heat, cold, drought, salinity and ultraviolet radiation.\nPreference is given to using the inventive compounds of the formula (I) or salts thereof in economically important transgenic crops of useful and ornamental plants.\nThe compounds of the formula (I) can be used as herbicides in crops of useful plants which are resistant, or have been made resistant by genetic engineering, to the phytotoxic effects of the herbicides.\nConventional ways of producing novel plants which have modified properties in comparison to existing plants consist, for example, in traditional cultivation methods and the generation of mutants. Alternatively, novel plants with altered properties can be generated with the aid of recombinant methods (see, for example, EP 0221044, EP 0131624). What have been described are, for example, several cases of genetic modifications of crop plants for the purpose of modifying the starch synthesized in the plants (e.g. WO 92/011376 A, WO 92/014827 A, WO 91/019806 A), transgenic crop plants which are resistant to certain herbicides of the glufosinate type (cf., for exam",

With the aid of standard methods, it is possible, for example, to undertake base exchanges, remove part sequences or add natural or synthetic sequences. For the connection of the DNA fragments to one another, it is possible to add adapters or linkers to the fragments; see, for example, Sambrook et al., 1989, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY; or Winnacker “Gene und Klone” [Genes and Clones], VCH Weinheim, 2nd edition, 1996.  \nFor example, the generation of plant cells with a reduced activity of a gene product can be achieved by expressing at least one corresponding antisense RNA, a sense RNA for achieving a cosuppression effect, or by expressing at least one suitably constructed ribozyme which specifically cleaves transcripts of the abovementioned gene product. To this end, it is firstly possible to use DNA molecules which encompass the entire coding sequence of a gene product inclusive of any flanking sequences which may be present, and also DNA molecules which only encompass portions of the coding sequence, in which case it is necessary for these portions to be long enough to have an antisense effect in the cells. It is also possible to use DNA sequences which have a high degree of homology to the coding sequences of a gene product, but are not completely identical to them.\nWhen expressing nucleic acid molecules in plants, the protein synthesized may be localized in any desired compartment of the plant cell. However, to achieve localization in a particular compartment, it is possible, for example, to join the coding region to DNA sequences which ensure localization in a particular compartment.

They may be produced, for example, by wet-grinding by means of commercial bead mills and optional addition of surfactants as already listed above, for example, for the other formulation types.\nEmulsions, for example oil-in-water emulsions (EW), can be produced, for example, by means of stirrers, colloid mills and/or static mixers using aqueous organic solvents and optionally surfactants as already listed above, for example, for the other formulation types.\nGranules can be produced either by spraying the active ingredient onto granular inert material capable of adsorption or by applying active ingredient concentrates to the surface of carrier substances, such as sand, kaolinites or granular inert material, by means of adhesives, for example polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate or else mineral oils. Suitable active ingredients can also be granulated in the manner customary for the production of fertilizer granules—if desired as a mixture with fertilizers.\nWater-dispersible granules are produced generally by the customary processes such as spray-drying, fluidized-bed granulation, pan granulation, mixing with high-speed mixers and extrusion without solid inert material.\nFor the production of pan granules, fluidized bed granules, extruder granules and spray granules, see, for example, processes in “Spray-Drying Handbook” 3rd ed. 1979, G.

In wettable powders, the active ingredient concentration is, for example, about 10% to 90% by weight, the remainder to 100% by weight consisting of customary formulation constituents. In emulsifiable concentrates, the active ingredient concentration may be about 1% to 90% and preferably 5% to 80% by weight.

Preparations in dust form, granules for soil application or granules for scattering and sprayable solutions are not normally diluted further with other inert substances prior to application.\nThe required application rate of the compounds of the formula (I) and their salts varies according to the external conditions such as, inter alia, temperature, humidity and the type of herbicide used. It can vary within wide limits, for example between 0.001 and 10.0 kg/ha or more of active substance, but it is preferably between 0.005 and 5 kg/ha, more preferably in the range of from 0.01 to 1.5 kg/ha, particularly preferably in the range of from 0.05 to 1 kg/ha.

Preferably, the seed is treated in a state in which it is sufficiently stable for no damage to occur in the course of treatment. In general, the seed can be treated at any time between harvest and sowing. It is customary to use seed which has been separated from the plant and freed from cobs, shells, stalks, coats, hairs or the flesh of the fruits.

In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering methods, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (genetically modified organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term “parts” or “parts of plants” or “plant parts” has been explained above. Particular preference is given in accordance with the invention to treating plants of the respective commercially customary plant cultivars or those that are in use. Plant cultivars are understood to mean plants having new properties (“traits”) which have been grown by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They may be cultivars, varieties, biotypes and genotypes.  \nThe treatment method of the invention can be used for the treatment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), e.g. plants or seeds. Genetically modified plants (or transgenic plants) are plants in which a heterologous gene has been stably integrated into the genome. The term “heterologous gene” means essentially a gene which is provided or assembled outside the plant and which, upon introduction into the nuclear genome, the chloroplast genome or the mitochondrial genome, imparts to the transformed plant novel or improved agronomic or other traits because it expresses a protein or polypeptide of interest or another gene which is present in the plant, or other genes which are present in the plant are down-regulated or switched off (for example by means of antisense technology, co-suppression technology or RNAi technology [RNA interference]). A heterologous gene that is located in the genome is also called a transgene. A transgene that is defined by its specific presence in the plant genome is called a transformation or transgenic event.\nDepending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the inventive treatment may also result in superadditive (“synergistic”) effects",

Such plants are typically produced by crossing an inbred male-sterile parent line (the female crossbreeding parent) with another inbred male-fertile parent line (the male crossbreeding parent). Hybrid seed is typically harvested from the male-sterile plants and sold to growers. Male-sterile plants can sometimes (e.g. in maize) be produced by detasselling (i.e. the mechanical removal of the male reproductive organs or male flowers) but, more typically, male sterility is the result of genetic determinants in the plant genome. In that case, and especially when seed is the desired product to be harvested from the hybrid plants, it is typically beneficial to ensure that male fertility in hybrid plants, which contain the genetic determinants responsible for male sterility, is fully restored. This can be accomplished by ensuring that the male crossbreeding parents have appropriate fertility restorer genes which are capable of restoring the male fertility in hybrid plants that contain the genetic determinants responsible for male sterility. Genetic determinants for male sterility may be located in the cytoplasm. Examples of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) were for instance described for Brassica species. However, genetic determinants for male sterility can also be located in the nuclear genome. Male-sterile plants can also be obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering. A particularly useful means of obtaining male-sterile plants is described in WO 89/10396 in which, for example, a ribonuclease such as a barnase is selectively expressed in the tapetum cells in the stamens. Fertility can then be restored by expression in the tapetum cells of a ribonuclease inhibitor such as barstar.\nPlants or plant cultivars (obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering) which may be treated according to the invention are herbicide-toleran",

Such plants can be obtained either by genetic transformation, or by selection of plants containing a mutation imparting such herbicide tolerance.\nHerbicide-tolerant plants are for example glyphosate-tolerant plants, i.e. plants made tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate or salts thereof. Plants can be made tolerant to glyphosate by various methods. Thus, for example, glyphosate-tolerant plants can be obtained by transforming the plant with a gene encoding the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS). Examples of such EPSPS genes are the AroA gene (mutant CT7) of the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium (Comai et al., 1983, Science, 221, 370-371), the CP4 gene of the bacterium Agrobacterium sp. (Barry et al., 1992, Curr. Topics Plant Physiol. 7, 139-145), the genes encoding a petunia EPSPS (Shah et al., 1986, Science 233, 478-481), a tomato EPSPS (Gasser et al., 1988, J. Biol. Chem. 263, 4280-4289) or an Eleusine EPSPS (WO 01/66704). It can also be a mutated EPSPS. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by expressing a gene that encodes a glyphosate oxidoreductase enzyme. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by expressing a gene that encodes a glyphosate acetyltransferase enzyme. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by selecting plants containing naturally-occurring mutations of the abovementioned genes. Plants which express EPSPS genes which impart glyphosate tolerance have been described. Plants which express other genes which impart glyphosate tolerance, for example decarboxylase genes, have been described.\nOther herbicide-resistant plants are for example plants made tolerant to herbicides inhibiting the enzyme glutamine synthase, such as bialaphos, phosphi",

Such plants can be obtained by expressing an enzyme detoxifying the herbicide or a mutant of the glutamine synthase enzyme that is resistant to inhibition. One example of such an effective detoxifying enzyme is an enzyme encoding a phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (such as the bar or pat protein from Streptomyces species). Plants expressing an exogenous phosphinothricin acetyltransferase have been described.  \nFurther herbicide-tolerant plants are also plants that have been made tolerant to the herbicides inhibiting the enzyme hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD). Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenases are enzymes that catalyse the reaction in which para-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP) is converted to homogentisate. Plants tolerant to HPPD inhibitors can be transformed with a gene encoding a naturally-occurring resistant HPPD enzyme, or a gene encoding a mutated or chimeric HPPD enzyme, as described in WO 96/38567, WO 99/24585, WO 99/24586, WO 2009/144079, WO 2002/046387 or U.S. Pat. No. 6,768,044. Tolerance to HPPD inhibitors can also be obtained by transforming plants with genes encoding certain enzymes enabling the formation of homogentisate despite inhibition of the native HPPD enzyme by the HPPD inhibitor. Such plants are described in WO 99/34008 and WO 02/36787. Tolerance of plants to HPPD inhibitors can also be improved by transforming plants with a gene encoding a prephenate dehydrogenase enzyme in addition to a gene encoding an HPPD-tolerant enzyme, as described in WO 2004/024928. In addition, plants can be made even more tolerant to HPPD inhibitors by inserting into the genome thereof a gene which encodes an enzyme which metabolises or degrades HPPD inhibitors, for example CYP450 enzymes (see WO 2007/103567 and WO 2008/150473).\nOther he",

Known ALS inhibitors include, for example, sulfonylurea, imidazolinone, triazolopyrimidines, pyrimidinyloxy(thio)benzoates, and/or sulfonylaminocarbonyltriazolinone herbicides. It is known that different mutations in the ALS enzyme (also known as acetohydroxy acid synthase, AHAS) confer tolerance to different herbicides and groups of herbicides, as described, for example, in Tranel and Wright (Weed Science 2002, 50, 700-712). The production of sulfonylurea-tolerant plants and imidazolinone-tolerant plants has been described. Further sulfonylurea- and imidazolinone-tolerant plants have also been described.\nFurther plants tolerant to imidazolinones and/or sulfonylureas can be obtained by induced mutagenesis, by selection in cell cultures in the presence of the herbicide or by mutation breeding (cf., for example, for soya bean U.S. Pat. No. 5,084,082, for rice WO 97/41218, for sugar beet U.S. Pat. No. 5,773,702 and WO 99/057965, for lettuce U.S. Pat.

In the case of broad signals, several peaks or the middle of the signal and the relative intensity thereof may be shown in comparison to the most intense signal in the spectrum.\nFor calibration of the chemical shift of 1H NMR spectra, we use tetramethylsilane and/or the chemical shift of the solvent, particularly in the case of spectra which are measured in DMSO. Therefore, the tetramethylsilane peak may but need not occur in NMR peak lists.\nThe lists of the 1H NMR peaks are similar to the conventional 1H NMR printouts and thus usually contain all peaks listed in a conventional NMR interpretation.\nIn addition, like conventional 1H NMR printouts, they may show solvent signals, signals of stereoisomers of the target compounds which are likewise provided by the invention, and/or peaks of impurities.\nIn the reporting of compound signals within the delta range of solvents and/or water, our lists of 1H NMR peaks show the standard solvent peaks, for example peaks of DMSO in DMSO-D6 and the peak of water, which usually have a high intensity on average.\nThe peaks of stereoisomers of the target compounds and/or peaks of impurities usually have a lower intensity on average than the peaks of the target compounds (for example with a purity of >90%).\nSuch stereoisomers and/or impurities may be typical of the particular preparation process. Their peaks can thus help in this case to identify reproduction of our preparation process with reference to “by-product fingerprints”.\nAn expert calculating the peaks of the target compounds by known methods (MestreC, ACD simulation, but also with empirically evaluated expected values) can, if required, isolate the peaks of the target compounds, optionally using additional intensity filters.

What has been described are, for example, several cases of genetic modifications of crop plants for the purpose of modifying the starch synthesized in the plants (e.g. WO 92/011376 A, WO 92/014827 A, WO 91/019806 A), transgenic crop plants which are resistant to certain herbicides of the glufosinate type (cf., for example, EP 0242236 A, EP 0242246 A) or of the glyphosate type (WO 92/000377A) or of the sulfonylurea type (EP 0257993 A, U.S. Pat.

Potrykus and G. Spangenberg (eds), Gene Transfer to Plants, Springer Lab Manual (1995), Springer Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg or Christou, “Trends in Plant Science” 1 (1996) 423-431).\nFor such genetic manipulations, nucleic acid molecules which allow mutagenesis or sequence alteration by recombination of DNA sequences can be introduced into plasmids. With the aid of standard methods, it is possible, for example, to undertake base exchanges, remove part sequences or add natural or synthetic sequences. For the connection of the DNA fragments to one another, it is possible to add adapters or linkers to the fragments; see, for example, Sambrook et al., 1989, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY; or Winnacker “Gene und Klone” [Genes and Clones], VCH Weinheim, 2nd edition, 1996.\nFor example, the generation of plant cells with a reduced activity of a gene product can be achieved by expressing at least one corresponding antisense RNA, a sense RNA for achieving a cosuppression effect, or by expressing at least one suitably constructed ribozyme which specifically cleaves transcripts of the abovementioned gene product.

To this end, it is firstly possible to use DNA molecules which encompass the entire coding sequence of a gene product inclusive of any flanking sequences which may be present, and also DNA molecules which only encompass portions of the coding sequence, in which case it is necessary for these portions to be long enough to have an antisense effect in the cells. It is also possible to use DNA sequences which have a high degree of homology to the coding sequences of a gene product, but are not completely identical to them.\nWhen expressing nucleic acid molecules in plants, the protein synthesized may be localized in any desired compartment of the plant cell. However, to achieve localization in a particular compartment, it is possible, for example, to join the coding region to DNA sequences which ensure localization in a particular compartment. Such sequences are known to those skilled in the art (see, for example, Braun et al., EMBO J. 11 (1992), 3219-3227; Wolter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 (1988), 846-850; Sonnewald et al., Plant J. 1 (1991), 95-106). The nucleic acid molecules can also be expressed in the organelles of the plant cells.\nThe transgenic plant cells can be regenerated by known techniques to give rise to entire plants. In principle, the transgenic plants may be plants of any desired plant species, i.e. not only monocotyledonous but also dicotyledonous plants.

This relates to the seed of plants containing at least one heterologous gene which enables the expression of a polypeptide or protein having insecticidal properties. The heterologous gene in transgenic seed can originate, for example, from microorganisms of the species Bacillus, Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Trichoderma, Clavibacter, Glomus or Gliocladium. This heterologous gene preferably originates from Bacillus sp., in which case the gene product is effective against the European corn borer and/or the Western corn rootworm. The heterologous gene more preferably originates from Bacillus thuringiensis.\nIn the context of the present invention, the inventive composition is applied to the seed alone or in a suitable formulation. Preferably, the seed is treated in a state in which it is sufficiently stable for no damage to occur in the course of treatment. In general, the seed can be treated at any time between harvest and sowing. It is customary to use seed which has been separated from the plant and freed from cobs, shells, stalks, coats, hairs or the flesh of the fruits. For example, it is possible to use seed which has been harvested, cleaned and dried down to a moisture content of less than 15% by weight. Alternatively, it is also possible to use seed which, after drying, for example, has been treated with water and then dried again.\nIn general, when treating the seed, it has to be ensured that the amount of the composition of the invention and/or further additives applied to the seed is chosen such that the germination of the seed is not impaired and the plant which arises therefrom is not damaged.

In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering methods, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (genetically modified organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term “parts” or “parts of plants” or “plant parts” has been explained above. Particular preference is given in accordance with the invention to treating plants of the respective commercially customary plant cultivars or those that are in use. Plant cultivars are understood to mean plants having new properties (“traits”) which have been grown by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They may be cultivars, varieties, biotypes and genotypes.\nThe treatment method of the invention can be used for the treatment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), e.g. plants or seeds. Genetically modified plants (or transgenic plants) are plants in which a heterologous gene has been stably integrated into the genome. The term “heterologous gene” means essentially a gene which is provided or assembled outside the plant and which, upon introduction into the nuclear genome, the chloroplast genome or the mitochondrial genome, imparts to the transformed plant novel or improved agronomical or other traits because it expresses a protein or polypeptide of interest or another gene which is present in the plant, or other genes which are present in the plant are down-regulated or switched off (for example by means of antisense technology, co-suppression technology or RNAi technology [RNA interference]).

For example, the\nfollowing effects which exceed the effects actually to be expected are possible: reduced application rates and/or widened spectrum of activity and/or increased efficacy of the active ingredients and compositions which can be used in accordance with the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salinity, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, bigger fruits, greater plant height, greener leaf color, earlier flowering, higher quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, higher sugar concentration within the fruits, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products.\nPlants and plant cultivars which are preferably treated in accordance with the invention include all plants which have genetic material which imparts particularly advantageous, useful traits to these plants (whether obtained by breeding and/or biotechnological means).\nExamples of nematode-resistant plants are described, for example, in the following U.S. patent application Ser.

Such plants are typically produced by crossing an inbred male-sterile parent line (the female crossbreeding parent) with another inbred male-fertile parent line (the male crossbreeding parent). Hybrid seed is typically harvested from the male-sterile plants and sold to growers. Male-sterile plants can sometimes (e.g. in maize) be produced by detasselling (i.e. the mechanical removal of the male reproductive organs or male flowers) but, more typically, male sterility is the result of genetic determinants in the plant genome. In that case, and especially when seed is the desired product to be harvested from the hybrid plants, it is typically beneficial to ensure that male fertility in hybrid plants, which contain the genetic determinants responsible for male sterility, is fully restored. This can be accomplished by ensuring that the male crossbreeding parents have appropriate fertility restorer genes which are capable of restoring the male fertility in hybrid plants that contain the genetic determinants responsible for male sterility. Genetic determinants for male sterility may be located in the cytoplasm. Examples of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) were for instance described for Brassica species. However, genetic determinants for male sterility can also be located in the nuclear genome. Male-sterile plants can also be obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering. A particularly useful means of obtaining male-sterile plants is described in WO 89/10396 in which, for example, a ribonuclease such as a barnase is selectively expressed in the tapetum cells in the stamens.

Fertility can then be restored by expression in the tapetum cells of a ribonuclease inhibitor such as barstar.\nPlants or plant cultivars (obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering) which may be treated according to the invention are herbicide-tolerant plants, i.e. plants made tolerant to one or more given herbicides. Such plants can be obtained either by genetic transformation, or by selection of plants containing a mutation imparting such herbicide tolerance.\nHerbicide-tolerant plants are for example glyphosate-tolerant plants, i.e. plants made tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate or salts thereof. Plants can be made tolerant to glyphosate by various methods. Thus, for example, glyphosate-tolerant plants can be obtained by transforming the plant with a gene encoding the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS). Examples of such EPSPS genes are the AroA gene (mutant CT7) of the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium (Comai et al., 1983, Science, 221, 370-371), the CP4 gene of the bacterium Agrobacterium sp. (Barry et al., 1992, Curr. Topics Plant Physiol. 7, 139-145), the genes encoding a petunia EPSPS (Shah et al., 1986, Science 233, 478-481), a tomato EPSPS (Gasser et al., 1988, J. Biol. Chem. 263, 4280-4289) or an Eleusine EPSPS (WO 01/66704). It can also be a mutated EPSPS. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by expressing a gene that encodes a glyphosate oxidoreductase enzyme. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by expressing a gene that encodes a glyphosate acetyltransferase enzyme. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by selecting plants containing naturally-occurring mutations of the abovementioned genes. Plants which express EPSPS genes which impart glyphosate tolerance have been described. Plants which express other genes which impart glyphosate tolerance, for example decarboxylase g",

Plants which express other genes which impart glyphosate tolerance, for example decarboxylase genes, have been described.\nOther herbicide-resistant plants are for example plants made tolerant to herbicides inhibiting the enzyme glutamine synthase, such as bialaphos, phosphinothricin or glufosinate. Such plants can be obtained by expressing an enzyme detoxifying the herbicide or a mutant of the glutamine synthase enzyme that is resistant to inhibition. One example of such an effective detoxifying enzyme is an enzyme encoding a phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (such as the bar or pat protein from Streptomyces species). Plants expressing an exogenous phosphinothricin acetyltransferase have been described.\nFurther herbicide-tolerant plants are also plants that have been made tolerant to the herbicides inhibiting the enzyme hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD). Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenases are enzymes that catalyse the reaction in which para-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP) is converted to homogentisate. Plants tolerant to HPPD inhibitors can be transformed with a gene encoding a naturally-occurring resistant HPPD enzyme, or a gene encoding a mutated or chimeric HPPD enzyme, as described in WO 96/38567, WO 99/24585, WO 99/24586, WO 2009/144079, WO 2002/046387 or U.S. Pat. No. 6,768,044. Tolerance to HPPD inhibitors can also be obtained by transforming plants with genes encoding certain enzymes enabling the formation of homogentisate despite inhibition of the native HPPD enzyme by the HPPD inhibitor. Such plants are described in WO 99/34008 and WO 02/36787. Tolerance of plants to HPPD inhibitors can also be improved by transforming plants with a gene encoding a prephenate dehydrogenase enzyme in addition to a gene encoding an HPPD-tolerant enzyme, as described in WO 2004/024928.

Known ALS inhibitors include, for example, sulfonylurea, imidazolinone, triazolopyrimidines, pyrimidinyloxy(thio)benzoates, and/or sulfonylaminocarbonyltriazolinone herbicides. It is known that different mutations in the ALS enzyme (also known as acetohydroxy acid synthase, AHAS) confer tolerance to different herbicides and groups of herbicides, as described, for example, in Tranel and Wright (Weed Science 2002, 50, 700-712). The production of sulfonylurea-tolerant plants and imidazolinone-tolerant plants has been described. Further sulfonylurea- and imidazolinone-tolerant plants have also been described.\nFurther plants tolerant to imidazolinones and/or sulfonylureas can be obtained by induced mutagenesis, by selection in cell cultures in the presence of the herbicide or by mutation breeding (cf., for example, for soya beans U.S. Pat.

For each signal peak, first the δ value in ppm and then the signal intensity in round brackets are listed. The δ value-signal intensity number pairs for different signal peaks are listed with separation from one another by semicolons.\nThe peak list for one example therefore takes the form of: δ1 (intensity1); δ2 (intensity2); . . . ; δi(intensityi); . . . ; δn(intensityn)\nThe intensity of sharp signals correlates with the height of the signals in a printed example of an NMR spectrum in cm and shows the true ratios of the signal intensities. In the case of broad signals, several peaks or the middle of the signal and the relative intensity thereof may be shown in comparison to the most intense signal in the spectrum.\nFor calibration of the chemical shift of 1H NMR spectra we use tetramethylsilane and/or the chemical shift of the solvent, particularly in the case of spectra measured in DMSO. Therefore, the tetramethylsilane peak may but need not occur in NMR peak lists.\nThe lists of the 1H NMR peaks are similar to the conventional 1H NMR printouts and thus usually contain all peaks listed in a conventional NMR interpretation.\nIn addition, like conventional 1H NMR printouts, they may show solvent signals, signals of stereoisomers of the target compounds, which likewise form part of the subject matter of the invention, and/or peaks of impurities.\nIn the reporting of compound signals in the delta range of solvents and/or water, our lists of 1H NMR peaks show the usual solvent peaks, for example peaks of DMSO in DMSO-D6 and the peak of water, which usually have a high intensity on average.\nThe peaks of stereoisomers of the target compounds and/or peaks of impurities usually have a lower intensity on average t",

Known representatives of ticks are, for example, Boophilus, Amblyomma, Anocentor, Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma, Ixodes, Rhipicentor, Margaropus, Rhipicephalus, Argas, Otobius and Ornithodoros and the like, which preferably infest vertebrates, for example warm-blooded animals including farm animals, such as cattle, horses, pigs, sheep and goats, poultry such as chickens, turkeys, guineafowls and geese, fur-bearing animals such as mink, foxes, chinchillas, rabbits and the like, as well as companion animals such as ferrets, guinea pigs, rats, hamster, cats and dogs, but also humans and fishes.\nThe compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention are also active against all or individual development stages of animal pests showing normal sensitivity, as well as those showing resistance to widely used parasiticides. This is especially true for resistant insects and members of the order Acarina. The insecticidal, ovicidal and/or acaricidal effect of the active substances of the invention can manifest itself directly, i.e. killing the pests either immediately or after some time has elapsed, for example when moulting occurs, or by destroying their eggs, or indirectly, e.g. reducing the number of eggs laid and/or the hatching rate, good efficacy corresponding to a pest",

The present invention is not restricted to two-fold combinations.\nAs a rule, the insecticidal and acaricidal compositions according to the invention contain 0.1 to 99% by weight, especially 0.1 to 95% by weight of one or more active ingredients of formula (I), 99.9 to 1% by weight, especially 99.8 to 5% by weight of a solid or liquid admixture, including 0 to 25% by weight, especially 0.1 to 25% by weight of a surfactant.

These pour-on and spot-on formulations are designed to spread all around the animal giving protection or treatment to almost any part of the animal. Even so the administration is carried out by applying a swab or spray of the pour-on or spot-on formulation to a relatively small area of the coat, one observes that from the active substance is dispersed almost automatically over wide areas of the fur owing to the spreading nature of the components in the formulation and assisted by the animal's movements.\nPour-on or spot-on formulations suitably contain carriers, which promote rapid dispersement over the skin surface or in the coat of the host animal, and are generally regarded as spreading oils. Suitable carriers are e.g. oily solutions; alcoholic and isopropanolic solutions such as solutions of 2-octyldodecanol or oleyl alcohol; solutions in esters of monocarboxylic acids, such as isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, lauric acid oxalate, oleic acid oleyl ester, oleic acid decyl ester, hexyl laurate, oleyl oleate, decyl oleate, capric acid esters of saturated fat alcohols of chain length C12-C18; solutions of esters of dicarboxylic acids, such as dibutyl phthalate, diisopropyl isophthalate, adipic acid diisopropyl ester, di-n-butyl adipate or also solutions of esters of aliphatic acids, e.g. glycols.

Subsequently, 0.2 g of the test feed was placed in each of the treatment areas of a plastic test container (volume: 1.4 ml). Subsequently, two second-instar larvae of Mythimna separata were inoculated into each treatment area, and a plastic lid was placed on the test container to prevent the larvae from escaping. The closed container was placed in a thermostatic chamber at 25° C. On the 5th day therefrom, the insect mortality rate and the amount of feed consumed were checked. The test was repeated.\nIn addition, for a control area, the insect mortality rate and the amount of feed consumed were checked in the same manner as that described in Test Example 1, with the exception of replacing the emulsion (I) with the emulsion (II).\nEfficacy tests against Mythimna separata were conducted for the compounds of Compound Nos. 1-13, 2-3, 2-5, 2-6, 2-8, 2-9, 2-14, 2-15, 2-16, 2-17, 2-18, 2-22, 2-25, 2-36, 3-8, 3-46, and 3-47.

It can be seen that the (hetero)aryl sulfonamide compounds of the present invention are effective against Mythimna separata.\nEfficacy Test against Spodoptera litura\nThe emulsion (I) was diluted with water to achieve a concentration of the compound of the present invention of 125 ppm. Cabbage leaves were soaked in the diluted liquid for 30 seconds. These cabbage leaves were then placed in a Petri dish, and five second-instar larvae of Spodoptera litura were released into the Petri dish.

Furthermore, the (hetero)arylamide compound can effectively control ectoparasites that harm humans and livestock.\nThe (hetero)arylamide compound of the present invention is a compound represented by Formula (I) (hereinafter sometimes referred to as a compound (I)) or a salt of the compound (I).\nIn the present invention, a term “unsubstituted” means only a group that serves as a mother nucleus. In a case where the group that serves as a mother nucleus is described only with the name without a description of “substituted”, it means an “unsubstituted” group unless otherwise specified.\nOn the other hand, the term “substituted” means that any hydrogen atom in the group serving as a mother nucleus is substituted with a group (a substituent) having the same structure or a different structure as that of the mother nucleus. Accordingly, the “substituent” is another group bonded to the group serving as a mother nucleus. The number of the substituents may be one or two or more. Two or more substituents may be the same as or different from each other.\nThe term “C1 to C6” or the like indicates that the number of carbon atoms in the group serving as a mother nucleus is 1 to 6. The number of carbon atoms in the substituent is not included in the number of carbon atoms. For example, an ethoxybutyl group is classified into a C2 alkoxy C4 alkyl group since the group serving as a mother nucleus is a butyl group and the substituent is an ethoxy group.\nThe “substituent” is chemically acceptable and is not particularly limited as long as it has the effect of the present invention.\nSpecific examples of the group that can be the “substituent” include the following groups.  \nA halogeno group such as a fluoro group, a chloro group, a bromo group, and an iodo group; a C1 to C6 alkyl group such as a methyl group, an ethyl group, an n-propyl group, an i-propyl group, an n-butyl group, an s-butyl group, an i-butyl group, a t-but",

This group includes many of the beans cultivated for human and animal food, most importantly from the genera Phaseolus and Vigna.\nSoybean (genus Glycine) is considered to be an important crop of the Phaseoleae tribe and is highly valued by world agriculture. Therefore, one of the major objectives of the soybean breeders is to develop more stable, productive and disease-resistant varieties. The basic motivation is to maximize grain yield for human and animal consumption. In order to attain said objects, the breeder usually selects varieties having superior traits.\nAsian soybean rust (ASR), caused by the fungus Phakopsora pachyrhizi, is considered to be the most destructive soybean leaf disease (Miles, M. R.; Frederick R. D.; Hartman, G. (2003) Soybean rust: Is the U.S. soybean crop at risk? Online. APSnet Feature, American Phytopathological Society). The disease spreads by windblown uredospores which consequently let to long-distance dispersal to new, rust-free regions. Therefore, ASR has already caused losses in many soybean-growing regions of the world. The impact of the pathogen on productivity is drastic: up to 80% yield loss was observed in some regions (Yorinori J. T. (2004) Ferrugem “asiática” da soja no Brasil: evolução, importância econômica e controle. In: Junior J. N. Lazzarotto J. J. (eds.) Documentos 247. Embrapa, Londrina, Brazil, 36).\nIn order to control the disease, fungicides are applied or resistant or tolerant varieties are used.\nThe application of fungicides commonly bears the problem of unfavorable environmental or toxicological effects due to high dosage rates which are needed to effectively control the disease.\nFungus resistance is known to naturally occur in genotypes of the Glycine genus (Burdon, J.

Five qualitative dominant resistance genes have been identified (Meyer J. D.

The resistance presented by each gene is limited to the specific pathogen variety and can be overcome in a short period of time due to the coevolution of host resistance and pathogen virulence.

The (R)-enantiomers or compositions intervene in the metabolism of the plants and can therefore also be used as growth regulators.\nPlant growth regulators may exert various effects on plants. The effect of the substances depends essentially on the time of application in relation to the developmental stage of the plant, and also on the amounts of active ingredient applied to the plants or their environment and on the type of application. In each case, growth regulators should have a particular desired effect on the crop plants.\nPlant growth-regulating compounds can be used, for example, to inhibit the vegetative growth of the plants. Such inhibition of growth is of economic interest, for example, in the case of grasses, since it is thus possible to reduce the frequency of grass cutting in ornamental gardens, parks and sport facilities, on roadsides, at airports or in fruit crops. Also of significance is the inhibition of the growth of herbaceous and woody plants on roadsides and in the vicinity of pipelines or overhead cables, or quite generally in areas where vigorous plant growth is unwanted.\nAlso important is the use of growth regulators for inhibition of the longitudinal growth of cereal. This reduces or completely eliminates the risk of lodging of the plants prior to harvest. In addition, growth regulators in the case of cereals can strengthen t",

In addition, growth regulators in the case of cereals can strengthen the culm, which also counteracts lodging. The employment of growth regulators for shortening and strengthening culms allows the deployment of higher fertilizer volumes to increase the yield, without any risk of lodging of the cereal crop.\nIn many crop plants, inhibition of vegetative growth allows denser planting, and it is thus possible to achieve higher yields based on the soil surface. Another advantage of the smaller plants obtained in this way is that the crop is easier to cultivate and harvest.\nInhibition of the vegetative plant growth may also lead to enhanced yields because the nutrients and assimilates are of more benefit to flower and fruit formation than to the vegetative parts of the plants.\nFrequently, growth regulators can also be used to promote vegetative growth. This is of great benefit when harvesting the vegetative plant parts. However, promoting vegetative growth may also promote generative growth in that more assimilates are formed, resulting in more or larger fruits.\nIn some cases, yield increases may be achieved by manipulating the metabolism of the plant, without any detectable changes in vegetative growth. In addition, growth regulators can be used to alter the composition of the plants, which in turn may result in an improvement in quality of the harvested products. For example, it is possible to increase the sugar content in sugar beet, sugar cane, pineapples and in citrus fruit, or to increase the protein content in soya or cereals. It is also possible, for example, to use growth regulators to inhibit the degradation of desirable ingredients, for example sugar in sugar beet or sugar cane, before or after harvest. It is also possible to positively influence the production or the elimination of secondary plant ingredients. One example is the sti",

One example is the stimulation of the flow of latex in rubber trees.\nUnder the influence of growth regulators, parthenocarpic fruits may be formed. In addition, it is possible to influence the sex of the flowers. It is also possible to produce sterile pollen, which is of great importance in the breeding and production of hybrid seed.\nUse of growth regulators can control the branching of the plants. On the one hand, by breaking apical dominance, it is possible to promote the development of side shoots, which may be highly desirable particularly in the cultivation of ornamental plants, also in combination with an inhibition of growth. On the other hand, however, it is also possible to inhibit the growth of the side shoots. This effect is of particular interest, for example, in the cultivation of tobacco or in the cultivation of tomatoes.\nUnder the influence of growth regulators, the amount of leaves on the plants can be controlled such that defoliation of the plants is achieved at a desired time. Such defoliation plays a major role in the mechanical harvesting of cotton, but is also of interest for facilitating harvesting in other crops, for example in viticulture. Defoliation of the plants can also be undertaken to lower the transpiration of the plants before they are transplanted.\nGrowth regulators can likewise be used to regulate fruit dehiscence. On the one hand, it is possible to prevent premature fruit dehiscence. On the other hand, it is also possible to promote fruit dehiscence or even flower abortion to achieve a desired mass (“thinning”), in order to eliminate alternation.

This is particularly advantageous as it allows optimal adjustment to the requirements of the market. Moreover, growth regulators in some cases can improve the fruit colour. In addition, growth regulators can also be used to concentrate maturation within a certain period of time. This establishes the prerequisites for complete mechanical or manual harvesting in a single operation, for example in the case of tobacco, tomatoes or coffee.\nBy using growth regulators, it is additionally possible to influence the resting of seed or buds of the plants, such that plants such as pineapple or ornamental plants in nurseries, for example, germinate, sprout or flower at a time when they are normally not inclined to do so. In areas where there is a risk of frost, it may be desirable to delay budding or germination of seeds with the aid of growth regulators, in order to avoid damage resulting from late frosts.\nFinally, growth regulators can induce resistance of the plants to frost, drought or high salinity of the soil. This allows the cultivation of plants in regions which are normally unsuitable for this purpose.  \nThe (R)-enantiomers or compositions according to the invention also exhibit a potent strengthening effect in plants.

This is taken as a measure of the baking quality. Swelling of the gluten fraction of flour in lactic acid solution affects the rate of sedimentation of a flour suspension. Both a higher gluten content and a better gluten quality give rise to slower sedimentation and higher Zeleny test values. The sedimentation value of flour depends on the wheat protein composition and is mostly correlated to the protein content, the wheat hardness, and the volume of pan and hearth loaves.

The falling number test indicates that sprout damage may have occurred. It means that changes to the physical properties of the starch portion of the wheat kernel has already happened. Therein, the falling number instrument analyzes viscosity by measuring the resistance of a flour and water paste to a falling plunger. The time (in seconds) for this to happen is known as the falling number. The falling number results are recorded as an index of enzyme activity in a wheat or flour sample and results are expressed in time as seconds. A high falling number (for example, above 300 seconds) indicates minimal enzyme activity and sound quality wheat or flour. A low falling number (for example, below 250 seconds) indicates substantial enzyme activity and sproutdamaged wheat or flour.\nThe term “more developed root system”/“improved root growth” refers to longer root system, deeper root growth, faster root growth, higher root dry/fresh weight, higher root volume, larger root surface area, bigger root diameter, higher root stability, more root branching, higher number of root hairs, and/or more root tips and can be measured by analyzing the root architecture with suitable methodologies and Image analysis programmes (e.g. WinRhizo).\nThe term “crop water use efficiency” refers technically to the mass of agriculture produce per unit water consumed and economically to the value of product(s) produced per unit water volume consumed and can e.g. be measured in terms of yield per ha, biomass of the plants, thousand-kernel mass, and the number of ears per m2.\nThe term “nitrogen-use efficiency” refers te",

Fv/Fm is a parameter widely used to indicate the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (PSII). This parameter is widely considered to be a selective indication of plant photosynthetic performance with healthy samples typically achieving a maximum Fv/Fm value of approx. 0.85. Values lower than this will be observed if a sample has been exposed to some type of biotic or abiotic stress factor which has reduced the capacity for photochemical quenching of energy within PSII. Fv/Fm is presented as a ratio of variable fluorescence (Fv) over the maximum fluorescence value (Fm). The Performance Index is essentially an indicator of sample vitality.

In these methods, seed treated with at least one inventive mixture or composition is used.\nThe inventive (R)-enantiomers or compositions are also suitable for treating seed.

This phase is particularly critical since the roots and shoots of the growing plant are particularly sensitive, and even minor damage may result in the death of the plant. There is therefore a great interest in protecting the seed and the germinating plant by using appropriate compositions.\nThe control of phytopathogenic fungi by treating the seed of plants has been known for a long time and is the subject of constant improvements. However, the treatment of seed entails a series of problems which cannot always be solved in a satisfactory manner. For instance, it is desirable to develop methods for protecting the seed and the germinating plant, which dispense with, or at least significantly reduce, the additional deployment of crop protection compositions after planting or after emergence of the plants. It is also desirable to optimize the amount of the active ingredient used so as to provide the best possible protection for the seed and the germinating plant from attack by phytopathogenic fungi, but without damaging the plant itself by the active ingredient employed. In particular, methods for the treatment of seed should also take account of the intrinsic fungicidal properties of transgenic plants in order to achieve optimal protection of the seed and the germinating plant with a minimum expenditure of crop protection compositions.\nThe present invention therefore also relates to a method for protection of seed and germinating plants from attack by phytopathogenic fungi, by treating the seed with an inventive composition. The invention likewise relates to the use of the inventive compositions for treatment of seed to protect the seed and the germinating plant from phytopathogenic fungi.

Owing to the concerns regarding a possible influence of the crop protection compositions on the environment and the health of humans and animals, there are efforts to reduce the amount of active ingredients deployed.\nOne of the advantages of the present invention is that the particular systemic properties of the inventive mixtures or compositions mean that treatment of the seed with these active ingredients and compositions not only protects the seed itself, but also the resulting plants after emergence, from phytopathogenic fungi. In this way, the immediate treatment of the crop at the time of sowing or shortly thereafter can be dispensed with.\nIt is likewise considered to be advantageous that the inventive (R)-enantiomers or compositions can especially also be used with transgenic seed, in which case the plant growing from this seed is capable of expressing a protein which acts against pests. By virtue of the treatment of such seed with the inventive mixtures or compositions, merely the expression of the protein, for example an insecticidal protein, can control certain pests. Surprisingly, a further synergistic effect can be observed in this case, which additionally increases the effectiveness for protection against attack by pests.\nThe inventive compositions are suitable for protecting seed of soy in agriculture. As also described below, the treatment of transgenic seed with the inventive mixtures or compositions is of particular significance. This relates to the seed of plants containing at least one heterologous gene which enables the expression of a polypeptide or protein having insecticidal properties.

The heterologous gene in transgenic seed can originate, for example, from microorganisms of the species Bacillus, Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Trichoderma, Clavibacter, Glomus or Gliocladium. This heterologous gene preferably originates from Bacillus sp., in which case the gene product is effective against the European maize borer and/or the Western maize rootworm. The heterologous gene more preferably originates from Bacillus thuringiensis.  \nIn the context of the present invention, the inventive (R)-enantiomers or compositions are applied to the seed alone or in a suitable formulation. Preferably, the seed is treated in a state in which it is sufficiently stable for no damage to occur in the course of treatment. In general, the seed can be treated at any time between harvest and sowing. It is customary to use seed which has been separated from the plant and freed from cobs, shells, stalks, coats, hairs or the flesh of the fruits. For example, it is possible to use seed which has been harvested, cleaned and dried down to a moisture content of less than 15% by weight. Alternatively, it is also possible to use seed which, after drying, for example, has been treated with water and then dried again.\nWhen treating the seed, care must generally be taken that the amount of the inventive composition applied to the seed and/or the amount of further additives is selected such that the germination of the seed is not impaired, or that the resulting plant is not damaged. This has to be borne in mind in particular in the case of mixtures or compositions which can have phytotoxic effects at certain application rates.\nThe inventive (R)-enantiomers or compositions can be applied directly, i.e. without containing any other components and without having been diluted.

Genetically modified plants (or transgenic plants) are plants of which a heterologous gene has been stably integrated into genome. The expression “heterologous gene” essentially means a gene which is provided or assembled outside the plant and when introduced in the nuclear, chloroplastic or mitochondrial genome gives the transformed plant new or improved agronomic or other properties by expressing a protein or polypeptide of interest or by downregulating or silencing other gene(s) which are present in the plant (using for example, antisense technology, cosuppression technology, RNA interference—RNAi—technology or microRNA—miRNA—technology).

Further yield traits include seed composition, such as carbohydrate content, protein content, oil content and composition, nutritional value, reduction in anti-nutritional compounds, improved processability and better storage stability.  \nPlants that may be treated according to the invention are hybrid plants that already express the characteristic of heterosis or hybrid vigor which results in generally higher yield, vigor, health and resistance towards biotic and abiotic stresses). Such plants are typically made by crossing an inbred male-sterile parent line (the female parent) with another inbred male-fertile parent line (the male parent). Hybrid seed is typically harvested from the male sterile plants and sold to growers. Male sterile plants can sometimes (e.g. in corn) be produced by detasseling, i.e. the mechanical removal of the male reproductive organs (or males flowers) but, more typically, male sterility is the result of genetic determinants in the plant genome. In that case, and especially when seed is the desired product to be harvested from the hybrid plants it is typically useful to ensure that male fertility in the hybrid plants is fully restored. This can be accomplished by ensuring that the male parents have appropriate fertility restorer genes which are capable of restoring the male fertility in hybrid plants that contain the genetic determinants responsible for male-sterility.

However, genetic determinants for male sterility can also be located in the nuclear genome. Male sterile plants can also be obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering. A particularly useful means of obtaining male-sterile plants is described in WO 89/10396 in which, for example, a ribonuclease such as barnase is selectively expressed in the tapetum cells in the stamens. Fertility can then be restored by expression in the tapetum cells of a ribonuclease inhibitor such as batstar (e.g. WO 91/02069).\nPlants or plant cultivars (obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering) which may be treated according to the invention are herbicide-tolerant plants, i.e. plants made tolerant to one or more given herbicides.

Chem. 1988, 263, 4280-4289), or an Eleusine EPSPS (WO 01/66704). It can also be a mutated EPSPS as described in for example EP 0837944, WO 00/66746, WO 00/66747 or WO 02/26995. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by expressing a gene that encodes a glyphosate oxido-reductase enzyme as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,776,760 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,463,175. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by expressing a gene that encodes a glyphosate acetyl transferase enzyme as described in for example WO 02/036782, WO 03/092360, WO 2005/012515 and WO 2007/024782. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by selecting plants containing naturally-occurring mutations of the above-mentioned genes, as described in for example WO 01/024615 or WO 03/013226. Plants expressing EPSPS genes that confer glyphosate tolerance are described in e.g. U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 11/517,991, 10/739,610, 12/139,408, 12/352,532, 11/312,866, 11/315,678, 12/421,292, 11/400,598, 11/651,752, 11/681,285, 11/605,824, 12/468,205, 11/760,570, 11/762,526, 11/769,327, 11/769,255, 11/943801 or 12/362,774. Plants comprising other genes that confer glyphosate tolerance, such as decarboxylase genes, are described in e.g. U.S. patent application Ser.

Such plants can be obtained by expressing an enzyme detoxifying the herbicide or a mutant glutamine synthase enzyme that is resistant to inhibition, e.g. described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/760,602. One such efficient detoxifying enzyme is an enzyme encoding a phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (such as the bar or pat protein from Strep",

One such efficient detoxifying enzyme is an enzyme encoding a phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (such as the bar or pat protein from Streptomyces species). Plants expressing an exogenous phosphinothricin acetyltransferase are for example described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,561,236; 5,648,477; 5,646,024; 5,273,894; 5,637,489; 5,276,268; 5,739,082; 5,908,810 and 7,112,665.\nFurther herbicide-tolerant plants are also plants that are made tolerant to the herbicides inhibiting the enzyme hydroxyphenylpyruvatedioxygenase (HPPD). HPPD is an enzyme that catalyze the reaction in which parahydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP) is transformed into homogentisate. Plants tolerant to HPPD-inhibitors can be transformed with a gene encoding a naturally-occurring resistant HPPD enzyme, or a gene encoding a mutated or chimeric HPPD enzyme as described in WO 96/38567, WO 99/24585, WO 99/24586, WO 09/144079, WO 02/046387, or U.S. Pat. No. 6,768,044. Tolerance to HPPD-inhibitors can also be obtained by transforming plants with genes encoding certain enzymes enabling the formation of homogentisate despite the inhibition of the native HPPD enzyme by the HPPD-inhibitor. Such plants and genes are described in WO 99/34008 and WO 02/36787. Tolerance of plants to HPPD inhibitors can also be improved by transforming plants with a gene encoding an enzyme having prephenate deshydrogenase (PDH) activity in addition to a gene encoding an HPPDtolerant enzyme, as described in WO 04/024928. Further, plants can be made more tolerant to HPPD-inhibitor herbicides by adding into their genome a gene encoding an enzyme capable of metabolizing or degrading HPPD inhibitors, such as the CYP450 enzymes shown in WO 2007/103567 and WO 2008/150473.\nStill further herbicide resistant plants are plants that are made tolerant to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors.

These conditions can include exposure to low temperatures and limited access to water (such as drought). If the duration or severity of these stressful conditions is too great, the exposed plants may have reduced growth and yield. While plants have mechanisms to mitigate the effects of environmentally stressful conditions, continuous exposure may cause damage to the plants and can result in death of the plant. Reduced crop yield or death of crop plants due to environmentally stressful conditions is a major concern of plant growers.\nCrop growers desire to plant their crops as early as possible so that they can obtain the highest available yield during the growing season. Crop growers with a large acreage to plant also want to begin planting as soon as possible. Early planting, however, is not without risks. One risk is that the crops will be exposed to cold temperatures that may cause the seedlings or plants to suffer damage or death. Cold temperatures cause millions of dollars of damage to crops each year. In some parts of the United States, cold temperatures can occur at any time during the growing season. Cold temperature damage is most common, however, in the spring when the plants are vulnerable.\nUnfortunately, if cold temperature damage occurs to a grower's crops, the grower is then faced with a dilemma.

This was unexpected, as S-ABA, even at rates of up to 1000 mg/liter (113.7 g/acre), did not aid recovery growth following stress.\nSeveral responses were measured in the corn drought assays.

Corn plants of a commercial, 111 day, central corn belt variety were grown in the greenhouse under optimal conditions for five weeks and were size-matched into ten groups of five plants.

In contrast, the fresh weight data showed that the 3′-substituted-(S)-abscisic acid derivatives were considerably more active at preserving growth under drought than S-ABA. A regression of the fresh weight data and the associated potencies of the analogs demonstrate that the analogs were from 9.0 to 9.8 times as active as S-ABA at maintaining growth under drought conditions.\nCorn seed of a common inbred parental line were treated using standard seed treatment equipment with water (control), 40 μg, 80 μg or 160 μg/seed S-ABA, 10 μg, 20 μg, 40 μg or 80 μg/seed 3′-methyl-(S)-abscisic acid, or 10 μg, 20 μg, 40 μg or 80 μg/seed 3′-propargyl-(S)-abscisic acid.

Emergence counts were recorded almost daily until seedling emergence had ceased (42 days). Daily counts were converted to proportions of the final emergence to estimate the median emergence time for each box. Results of this emergence assay are shown below in Table 8.\nTABLE 8 Emergence of corn seeds treated with S-ABA, 3′-methyl-(S)-ABA or 3′-propargyl-(S)-ABA Delay in Median Time Median Emergence to Emergence Time Compared to Treatment (days) Control (days) Control 4.8 n/a S-ABA (40 μg/seed) 10.5 5.6 S-ABA (80 μg/seed) 13.0 8.2 S-ABA (160 μg/seed) 14.6 9.7 3′-Methyl-(S)-ABA (10 μg/seed) 9.7 4.9 3′-Methyl-(S)-ABA (20 μg/seed) 12.7 7.9 3′-Methyl-(S)-ABA (40 μg/seed) 16.0 11.1 3′-Methyl-(S)-ABA (80 μg/seed) 18.6 13.8 3′-Propargyl-(S)-ABA (10 μg/seed) 13.4 8.6 3′-Propargyl-(S)-ABA (20 μg/seed) 16.2 11.3 3′-Propargyl-(S)-ABA (40 μg/seed) 21.0 16.2 3′-Propargyl-(S)-ABA (80 μg/seed) 27.3 22.4  \nAs seen in Table 8, seed treatments containing 3′-methyl-(S)-abscisic acid, 3′-propargyl-(S)-abscisic acid or S-ABA greatly increased the median time of emergence as compared to the control, in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, Applicant unexpectedly discovered that both 3′-methyl-(S)-abscisic acid and 3′-propargyl-(S)-abscisic acid prolonged the delay in emergence when compared to S-ABA applied at equivalent rates. For example, at 80 μg/seed rate, 3′-methyl-(S)-abscisic acid extended the delay in emergence by an average of 5.6 additional calendar days in comparison with S-ABA (13.8 versus 8.2 days), while 3′-propargyl-(S)-abscisic acid extended the delay an additional 14.3 calendar days (22.4 versus 8.2 days).

At spraying, the primary leaves were fully expanded and the first trifoliate leaves were partially expanded. The plants were sprayed to dampness with solutions of water, S-ABA, 3′-methyl-(S)-abscisic acid, or 3′-propargyl-(S)-abscisic acid containing 0.025% (v/v) non-ionic surfactant.\nAt times following spraying, the conductance of the primary leaves was measured using an AP4 porometer (Delta T Devices, Cambridge, UK) to evaluate the effect on stomatal conductance. A decrease in stomatal aperture, reflected in the conductance measures, is an immediate and direct effect of applied S-ABA. To simplify the data, the controls were always set to 100%. In Table 9, the effect of spray applications on the stomatal conductance was measured.\nTABLE 9 The effect of foliar application of S-ABA, 3′-methyl-(S)-ABA, or 3′-propargyl-(S)-ABA on stomatal conductance of soybean Day 1 Day 2 Day 5 Day 6 Day 7 Control 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% S-ABA (300 mg/l) 42% 56% 80% 108% 122% 0.3 mg/plant S-ABA (1000 mg/l) 27% 32% 58% 80% 118% 1.0 mg/plant 3′-Methyl-(S)ABA 11% 18% 36% 68% 79% (300 mg/l) 0.3 mg/plant 3′-Propargyl-(S)- 8% 14% 33% 52% 57% ABA (300 mg/l) 0.3 mg/plant *Percent Conductance: All data have been normalized so the control at each time point is equal to 100% conductance.\nThe two 3′-substituted-(S)-abscisic derivatives showed both a greater magnitude and a longer duration of activity than was observed with S-ABA.

By day 2, the 300 mg/l S-ABA treatment had recovered greater than half of the control conductance, while a 50% recovery was observed with the 3′-substituted-(S)-abscisic acid derivatives at 6 days post application. This time was longer than was observed with 1000 mg/l of S-ABA, which showed greater than 50% recovery at day 5.\nThe decrease in stomatal conductance observed in response to the foliar treatments is an indicator of water use by the plants. Because most plant water loss is through the stomates, the ability to close the stomates to a greater amount and for a longer time, as was observed for the 3′-methyl-(S)-ABA and 3′-propargyl-(S)-ABA, is a significant improvement over the use of S-ABA, and could be used to increase drought tolerance.",
