    "content": "# Abstract\n\nHerbal medicines have been used for centuries to treat diverse health conditions and are increasingly sought after as people pursue natural, holistic care. Growing global concerns about the safety of herbal formulations, however, demand rigorous evaluation for contaminants such as heavy metals, aflatoxins, pesticides, and microbial pathogens. This study assessed the safety and quality of a polyherbal formulation developed for the management of uterine fibroids. Comprehensive screening included inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for heavy metals (arsenic, lead, mercury, cadmium), liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for aflatoxins, gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) for pesticide residues, and standard microbial assays for total viable counts and pathogenic organisms. Results showed heavy metal and aflatoxin levels within acceptable limits, no detectable pesticide residues, and minimal microbial load with no pathogens. These findings align with WHO and API standards, confirming the formulation’s safety and supporting its suitability for preclinical and clinical evaluation in uterine fibroid management.\n\nKeywords Safety study, Herbal medicine, World health organization, Uterine fibroid",

    "content": "# 1 Introduction\n\nHerbal medicines have earned a significant reputation throughout history and across cultures as primary and fundamental treatments for a wide range of health conditions. The origins of herbal medicine date back to the earliest days of human civilization, making it the oldest form of medical practice dedicated to promoting human well-being. Herbal medicine is a broad term encompassing a variety of treatments used alongside both conventional and alternative therapies. The approaches employed in herbal medicine are entirely distinct from those in modern conventional medicine. The historical roots of herbal medicine can be traced to ethnopharmacology, a term coined in 1967, which focuses on the scientific study of traditional medicinal plants [1]. Medicinal plants contain a variety of chemical compounds, including primary and secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenols. These plants and their extracts are generally used as therapeutic agents. Over $5 0 \\%$ of drugs in the Western pharmacopoeia are either directly derived from herbs or developed through modifications of plant-based compounds [2]. The importance of traditional medicinal systems is underscored by recent studies showing that $7 5 \\mathrm { - } 9 0 \\%$ of people in developing countries rely on herbal medicines for primary healthcare and other medical needs [3, 4].\n\nUterine fibroids are common non-cancerous tumors that develop in or around the uterus, affecting many women of reproductive age [5]. Various genetic, biological, and hormonal factors contribute to the development and growth of fibroids, which are particularly prevalent among Black women [6, 7]. Pharmacological interventions for fibroids include long-term use of GnRH agonists, combined oral contraceptives, levonorgestrelreleasing intrauterine systems, selective progesterone receptor modulators, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and NSAIDs. While these treatments show promising long-term efficacy, their extensive side effects limit clinical use. Hysterectomy remains the most definitive management for leiomyoma, but it carries a higher risk of adverse outcomes. Consequently, there is a significant demand for alternatives to surgical intervention, particularly for women who wish to preserve fertility. Many patients with uterine fibroids are therefore turning to natural remedies and complementary and alternative medicine for safer treatment options [8]. Evaluating the effectiveness of these therapies is crucial.\n\nIn the Unani system of medicine, the treatment of fibroid uterus (Usool-e-Ilaj) emphasizes the use of drugs with anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antioxidant properties [9]. Guided by these principles, a polyherbal formulation was designed, comprising Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Commiphora mukul, Bauhinia variegata, Cuscuta reflexa, Iris ensata, and Trigonella foenum-graecum. These plants were selected based on ethnopharmacological evidence for their antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and uterinemodulating effects [10, 11].\n\nDespite their therapeutic potential, herbal products may be contaminated with heavy metals, mycotoxins, pesticide residues, or microbial agents during cultivation, harvesting, processing, or storage. Such contaminants can compromise efficacy and pose serious health risks. Therefore, rigorous safety evaluation including chromatographic quantification of toxins, microbiological screening, and adherence to pharmacopoeial limits is essential to validate efficacy claims and ensure consumer protection.\n\n\n# 2 Materials and methods",

    "content": "# 4 Discussion\n\nHealth authorities and professionals have expressed growing concern regarding the quality and safety of herbal medicines, particularly due to contamination by heavy metals, microorganisms, aflatoxins, and pesticide residues. Such contamination not only reduces the therapeutic efficacy of these products but also poses significant health risks to consumers [26]. The term “heavy metals” generally refers to metallic elements with high density that are toxic even at low concentrations. This broad category includes metals and metalloids with an atomic density exceeding $\\mathrm { 4 ~ g / c m ^ { 3 } }$ , making them at least five times denser than water. The primary health hazards associated with heavy metals are linked to exposure to lead, cadmium, mercury, and arsenic. Medicinal plants form the basis of various herbal products, including medicines, teas, and oils, which are widely used due to their therapeutic benefits and are often regarded as safer alternatives to conventional allopathic treatments. However, there is increasing concern about the contamination of these herbal products and their ingredients with toxic heavy metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic [27]. Although certain metals are essential for biological functions, excessive intake can be harmful, reflecting the fundamental principle in toxicology: “the dose makes the poison,” which emphasizes that insufficient intake can lead to deficiencies, whereas excessive intake may cause adverse health effects [28].\n\nHeavy metal contamination is primarily caused by human activities, including mining, industrial operations, construction, agriculture, and improper waste disposal. The extensive use of pesticides and fertilizers further contributes to environmental contamination with metals such as lead, cadmium, mercury, and arsenic. These contaminants persist in soil and water, accumulate in plants and animals, and magnify through the food chain, ultimately posing serious health risks to humans and wildlife. Their persistence,tendency to bioaccumulate, and high toxicity make heavy metals a long-term environmental hazard. Exposure to these metals has been associated with numerous health issues, including impairment of the immune system, disruption of cardiovascular function, adverse effects on fetal development, and neurological, psychiatric, and sensory disorders. The severity of these effects depends on the dose, duration, and chemical form of the metals [29]. Lead, a highly toxic environmental contaminant, disrupts the function of various biomolecules by forming complexes with them. Chronic exposure to lead can cause impaired muscle coordination, gastrointestinal disturbances, brain and kidney damage, hearing and vision deficits, and reproductive disorders [30–32]. Cadmium toxicity is similarly associated with tissue damage [33–35], epigenetic modifications affecting DNA expression [36–38], hypertension [39], diabetes [40, 42], apoptosis [41], and insulin resistance [42, 43, 61, 63]. Arsenic, another hazardous heavy metal, poses substantial public health risks. Both acute and chronic arsenic toxicity interfere with the function of several vital enzymes. Like other heavy metals, arsenic can inhibit enzymes containing sulfhydryl groups, resulting in impaired enzymatic activity. Moreover, arsenic binds to the lipoic acid moiety of pyruvate dehydrogenase, inhibiting its activity, which disrupts the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, ultimately reducing ATP production and causing cellular damage [44]. Arsenic-induced damage to capillary endothelium further increases vascular permeability, leading to vasodilation and potential circulatory collapse [45].\n\nIn evaluations of heavy metals, four specific metals arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and lead were detected in test samples within the limits specified by the API and WHO [46,\n\n47]. The arsenic concentration in the test formulation was $0 . 0 8 4 0 0 \\pm \\ : 0 . 0 0 2 8 2 8$ , while the concentrations of lead, mercury, and cadmium were $0 . 0 6 2 5 0 \\pm 0 . 0 0 2 1 2 1$ , $0 . 0 0 3 5 0 \\pm$ 0.003536, and $0 . 0 1 0 5 0 \\pm 0 . 0 0 2 1 2 1$ , respectively (Table 2). All measured concentrations were significantly below permissible limits. In contrast, some studies have reported heavy metal levels exceeding permissible limits in herbal preparations, indicating a global safety concern and emphasizing the need for strict regulatory measures to prevent severe consumer health impacts [48, 49]. For example, a study in Nigeria analyzing 20 herbal preparations found lead, cadmium, and arsenic in $7 5 \\%$ of samples and mercury in $7 0 \\%$ at concentrations above safe limits, highlighting the urgent need for interventions to reduce heavy metal exposure [48].\n\nMicrobial contamination in herbal products can result from environmental pollution and soil contamination [50]. Plant-based medicines are particularly susceptible to contamination by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can pose significant health risks upon consumption. A study conducted in the USA identified antibiotic-resistant strains such as Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Erwinia spp., Ewingella americana, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in 29 herbal supplements obtained from local retailers [51]. Microbiological analysis of the test formulation (Table 3) revealed that Salmonella, S. aureus, Pseudomonas, and E. coli were not detected, and the total bacterial count was $5 . 2 \\times 1 0 ^ { 4 } \\pm 5 6 5 7 \\mathrm { c f u / g }$ , below the maximum permissible limit of 1.0 $\\times \\ 1 0 ^ { 5 } \\mathrm { c f u / g }$ . The fungal count was $1 . 1 \\times 1 0 ^ { 2 } \\pm 1 4 . 1 4 \\mathrm { c f u / g }$ , remaining within the acceptable limit of $1 . 0 \\times 1 0 ^ { 3 } \\ \\mathrm { c f u / g }$ . All measured values were well below permissible limits according to API standards. These findings are consistent with previous studies where pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella spp. and Shigella were not isolated from certain herbal preparations [52–54], as observed with DPHF, likely due to good manufacturing practices. Nonetheless, locally formulated herbal mixtures in Nigeria have shown microbial contamination, underlining the need for strict quality control during every stage of herbal preparation [55].\n\nAflatoxins B1, G1, B2, and G2 (AFB1, AFG1, AFB2, and AFG2) are toxic secondary metabolites produced by fungi, particularly Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus parasiticus, and Aspergillus nomius [56]. Recognized as potent natural carcinogens, aflatoxins primarily target the liver. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies AFB1 as a Group 1 human carcinogen, while AFG1, AFB2, and AFG2 fall under Group 2, indicating their potential carcinogenicity [57]. Aflatoxins are widely distributed in agricultural products such as cereals (rice, maize, sorghum, millet), cassava, nuts, oilseeds (e.g., sesame and sunflower), meat, eggs, dairy products, spices, and animal feeds [58]. Several studies have documented toxigenic fungi and mycotoxins in medicinal plants and herbal products [59]. These toxins may contaminate foods and herbal products at multiple stages, including pre-harvest, post-harvest, storage, and processing, particularly under conditions conducive to Aspergillus growth [60–62]. Post-harvest fungal spoilage can affect processed and stored herbal products, causing discoloration, reduced quality, and diminished therapeutic and commercial value. Furthermore, mycotoxins in contaminated herbal materials can adversely affect the liver, kidneys, nervous and muscular systems, skin, respiratory system, digestive tract, and reproductive organs [63, 64]. In the present study, aflatoxin B1 in test samples was $0 . 0 5 5 \\pm 0 . 0 2 1$ , and the total aflatoxin levels were $0 . 0 4 0 \\pm \\ : 0 . 0 1 4$ (Table 4), both below maximum permissible limits. In contrast, several studies have reported aflatoxin concentrations exceeding permissible limits, highlighting potential health risks. For instance, in Uganda, $6 0 \\%$ of herbal products contained AFB1, with $4 0 \\%$ exceeding WHO guidelines [65], while in South-Eastern Nigeria, 48 of 57 samples $( 8 4 . 2 1 \\% )$ tested positive for aflatoxins [66]. Additionally, Abdullah et al. reported AFB1 contamination in 25 of 31 herbal medicine samples, underscoring the health risks of aflatoxin-contaminated herbal products [67].\n\nPesticides are chemical substances designed to control pests and are categorized by purpose into insecticides, fungicides, nematocides, herbicides, rodenticides, and other groups [68]. Based on chemical structure, pesticides can be classified into organochlorines (OCPs, e.g., HCH, DDT), organophosphates (OPs, e.g., dichlorvos, malathion, parathion), nitrogen-based compounds (e.g., atrazine, propazine), and plant-derived pesticides (e.g., pyrethroids, rotenoids). Residues of these pesticides, along with their metabolites and degradation products, may remain in plants or soil and serve as significant sources of contamination in herbal medicines. Organochlorines act as central nervous system stimulants, causing symptoms such as tremors, hyperexcitability, and seizures. Though generally less acutely toxic than OPs or carbamates, organochlorines persist in the environment and bioaccumulate in tissues, making them highly hazardous. Overexposure to OPs primarily affects the nervous system, inducing headaches, dizziness, paraesthesia, tremors, lack of coordination, or convulsions. OPs inhibit acetylcholinesterase, causing accumulation of acetylcholine at nerve tissues and effector organs, leading to prolonged cholinergic stimulation. Chronic OP exposure can result in delayed neuropathy as a significant long-term effect [69]. In the present study, pesticide residues were not detected in the test herbal formulation (Table 5), confirming its safety with respect to pesticidal contamination.\n\nAlthough the current study confirms immediate safety, long-term exposure to trace contaminants necessitates ongoing monitoring to assess potential cumulative toxicity. Periodic re-evaluation is crucial to ensure sustained safety and efficacy. From an environmental perspective, overharvesting medicinal plants threatens biodiversity, while soil and water contamination can compromise herbal purity. Sustainable cultivation practices, including organic farming and bioremediation, can help mitigate these risks. By addressing these challenges, herbal medicine can continue to serve as a trusted and sustainable alternative to conventional therapies, maintaining public confidence while safeguarding human health and the environment.",

    "content": "# 5 Conclusion\n\nUnani Medicine is widely regarded as one of the safest medical systems due to its emphasis on drug purification and detoxification. However, potential contamination from environmental pollutants remains a concern. To ensure the safety of herbal formulations, the World Health Organization (WHO) mandates rigorous evaluations before therapeutic use. This study assessed four key safety parameters namely, heavy metal content, aflatoxins, microbial load, and pesticide residues to evaluate the safety of the test drug. The findings confirmed that heavy metals, including arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and lead, were within permissible limits. Aflatoxins, which are known for their hepatotoxic and carcinogenic potential, were also below the WHO threshold. Microbial contamination, including bacteria, yeast, and molds, remained within acceptable limits, and no pesticide residues were detected. All instrumental methods used for the safety analysis demonstrated accuracy within $1 - 3 \\%$ in solution analysis, with minimal interference from other compounds. These methods exhibited excellent precision due to their high sensitivity, very low relative standard deviation indicating consistent repeatability, and ultra-low detection limits, allowing for the easy identification of trace contaminants.\n\nThese results confirm that the test drug complies with international safety standards and is suitable for therapeutic use in managing uterine fibroids. By ensuring adherence to global safety standards, this study enhances public confidence in the use of herbal medicines. The findings further support the credibility of Unani formulations as safe and effective alternatives to conventional treatments. As herbal medicine continues to gain popularity, integrating traditional knowledge with modern scientific validation is essential for fostering wider acceptance and trust in natural therapies.",

Kordy1, Marwa I. Mackled2, Amira E. Ahmed2 & Shimaa S. Abd El-Naby3\n\nFormulation and adjuvant technologies can facilitate the use of insecticides that have higher biological efficiency application features. Safety, physicochemical properties by increasing consumer demand for safe food and enhancing operator safety. The aim of this current work was to develop a green efficient, and stable pesticide formulation. Therefore, certain nano emulsions with and without Adjuvants Calcium Alkyl Benzene Sulphonate (Atlox 4838B), and non-ionic surfactant based on trisiloxane ethoxylate (ARGAL), were testing against Sitophilus oryzae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Certain analytical techniques were used for determining the characterization of the nano emulsions (Sesame, Clove, and Cinnamon). Results showed that all formulations were penal, achieving nanometric size for all compounds. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrographs revealed spherical or quasi-spherical morphologies for the tested nanoemulsion formulation nanodroplets. Furthermore, dynamic light scattering (DLS) showed that the particle size of the formulation with the adjuvants showed a slight increase in the droplet size compared to the formulations without adjuvants. In comparison to the tested nanoemulsions with adjuvants, the viscosity of the nanoemulsions without adjuvants was lower. All studied formulations, both with and without adjuvant, showed an acidic to slightly acidic pH, except for sesame (NE) with AtloxTM 4838B, which showed a neutral pH, and they were kinetically stable with no phase separation, creaming, or crystallization. Furthermore, supporting the stability of these nanoemulsion particles was the absence of a separation phase following centrifugation, freeze– thaw cycles, and heating–cooling cycles. Findings proved that ARGAL and Atlox 4838B adjuvant stabilized NE by increasing Brownian motion, weakening the attractive forces with smaller droplets, increasing the value of zeta potential and polydispersive index $( < 0 . 6 ) ,$ , and decreasing surface tension. The bioassay technique using film residue to estimate LC50 values on S. oryzae adults indicate that Clove, Sesame, and Cinnamon nano emulsions with Atolx adjuvants were the most effective against S. oryzae adults under laboratory conditions, where the LC50 Values are 0.022, 0.032 and $0 . 0 3 5 \\mu \\mathsf { L } I$ $\\mathsf { c m } ^ { 2 }$ respectively after $2 7 \\mathsf { h } _ { \\iota }$ , or exposure time. Clove, Cinnamon, and Sesame nanoemulsion (NE) with $\\pmb { 0 . 0 1 \\% }$ (w/w) adjuvant exhibited remarkable insecticidal activity against S. oryzae L., of 100, 100 and $9 7 . 5 \\%$ respectively by in vitro assay.\n\nKeywords Adjuvant, Physicochemical properties, Nanoemulsion, Sesame, Clove, Cinnamon, S. oryzae, Kinetic stability\n\nAbbreviations $^ \\circ \\mathrm { C }$ Degree Celsius\n\nLC50 Lethal concentrations, which cause $5 0 \\%$ mortality in the population L.S.D Least significant different   \nS. oryzae Sitophilus oryzae L.   \nNE Nanoemulsion   \nPI Polydispersity index\n\nToday, agrochemical formulation development technology has become a well -established field that not only offers formulators significant added value, but also presents pesticide users with attractive products by enhancing operator safety1 . Current agrochemical discovery faces major challenges in a rapidly evolving market2 . These challenges including agrochemical resistance and their management, pest shifts3 changes in public perception of agricultural technology, the increasing cost of research and progress4 and evolving regulatory requirements2 . Lowering dosage rates and crop pesticide waste and ultimately improving environmental quality5,6 . Plant essential and natural oils can be employed as biopesticides as an alternative strategy for crop productivity and integrated pest control7 . Cloves (Syzygium aromaticum) belong to the Myrtaceae plant family. It is an aromatic flower that grows in Sri Lanka, China, Indonesia, and Madagascar. According to various sources, clove essential oil includes a large quantity of phenolic compounds Eugenol and Eugenol acetate8 , which have a variety of biological activities, including antibacterial, antifungal, insecticidal, and antioxidant characteristics9 . Cinnamomum zeylanicum is a Lauraceae plant that grows in India, Sri Lanka, Indochina, and Madagascar10. Jamaica and Brazil.11. Cinnamaldehyde, is a naturally occurring chemical found in the bark of cinnamon trees and other members of the Cinnamomum genus. Cinnamaldehyde contains about $9 0 \\%$ of the essential oil extracted from bark. Cinnamon oil also includes many chemical components (including cinnamic acid, coumaric acid, cinnamyl alcohol, and eugenol) with antioxidant and antibacterial properties12. Furthermore, insecticidal and repellant properties13.\n\nSesame (Sesamum indicum L.) is one of the oldest oil crops used for human consumption in the Pedaliaceae family14, mostly produced in India, Sudan, Myanmar, China, and Tanzania. Sesame oil is high in unsaturated fatty acids (linoleic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, arachidic acid, palmitoleic acid, linolenic acid, lignoceric acid, behenic acid, myristic acid, caproic acid, and margaric acid)15,16. Sesame is not only high in nutrients, but it also includes several key functional components such as sesamin, sesamol, sesamolin, sesaminol, sesamolin phenol, and other lignan-like active compounds17. Sesamin is a fungicide and insecticide that may be used in conjunction with pyrethroid insecticides18. The difficulty with using essential oils as insecticides is that they show poor solubility in water, high volatility, and sensitivity to environmental stresses19. In order to address this issue, essential oils can be formulated into nanoemulsions, which lessen the bioactive compounds’ volatility, hydrophobicity, and reactivity20. Nanoemulsion (NE) is an oil-in-water emulsion containing small, spherical oil droplets that are less than $2 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ in size21. It lowers the hydrophobicity, volatility, and reactivity of bioactive chemicals found in essential oils20. Furthermore, it improves the contact area between the components, spreading the oil across a broader surface and increasing biological activity. On the other hand, nanoemulsions are thermodynamically unstable, implying that nanodroplets might destabilize in numerous ways as they age. Coalescence and Ostwald ripening are well-known destabilizing processes in nanoemulsions22,23. As a result, there is an urgent need to identify effective adjutants that may stabilize the active components of most desirable nanoemulsion pesticides and provide increasing bio-efficacy and stability for a longer period. Additives have the potential to both improve the physical properties of pesticide formulations that have been pre-diluted as well as their biological efficacy. So, selecting the proper adjuvant is critical for establishing a stable nanoemulsion because of a high repulsive force that inhibits flocculation and coalescence between nanodroplets24.\n\nOrganosilicone and Alkyl Benzene Sulfonates adjuvants are compounds that are added to pesticides and other agricultural chemicals to increase droplet spreading and wetting. They also lower the spray solution’s surface tension, which increases pesticide penetration and results in a uniform distribution of the active ingredient on the plant surface25,26. Additives have the potential to both improve the physical properties of pesticide formulations that have been pre-diluted as well as their biological efficacy27. For instance28, reported that neem nanoemulsion with botanical adjuvant provided long-term storage stability as well as better adhesiveness and wetting with lower surface tension, as well as, Neem NE with adjuvant showed remarkable insecticidal effectiveness against whitefly. Furthermore29, found that adding adjuvants to olibanum NE improved stability and lowered surface tension and contact angle more effectively than olibanum NE alone. Additionally, the olibanum NE, with and without adjuvants, was the most effective chemical against the second instar larvae of the spiny bollworm (Earias insulana). Also30, demonstrated that the solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNPs) of citronella oil combined with three adjuvants increased the toxicity and mortality percentage of Spodoptera littoralis larvae, as well as stability, more than the nano formulation alone, furthermore31, evaluated the insecticidal efficacies and chemical compositions of some essential oil against the rice weevils, (S. oryzae L.). Also, the chemical pesticides such as lambda-cyhalothrin, Abamectin, Emamectin benzoate, Imidaclopride, and Oxamyl were detected to be more effective and longer-lasting effects when PEG 600 di-oleate adjuvants were added32,33. Adjuvants improved the efficacy of lambda-cyhalothrin formulations, according to34,35. Adjuvants or other inert chemicals can be added to neem NE to increase its biological activity36. Consequently, the number of treatments each season and the pace at which pesticides are applied can both be decreased by using adjuvants. As far as we are aware, no literature exists on the insecticidal properties of an improved formulation of sesame, clove, and cinnamon NE with different adjuvants against S. oryzae. So the purpose of this study was to specify the effect of two additives on increasing the effectiveness of the prepared nanoemulsion formulation of sesame, clove, and cinnamon oil against S. oryzae, maintaining or improving the physicochemical properties of the formulation, and aiding in the transition from preventative, high-dose applications to low-dose. Thus, this study could provide technical support for the development and utilization of efficient formulation.",

Photon correlation spectroscopy produces the hydrodynamic diameter, which is an intensity-weighted average diameter of the bulk population. PI represents the width of the particle size distribution. To achieve the desired scattering intensity, samples were diluted with water prior to analysis. For this, $1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { L }$ of material was mixed with about $1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { L }$ of water.\n\nSurface morphological analysis.\n\nThe morphological study of the tested formulations was carried out using JSM-IT200 (JJEOL, Japan) microscopes and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) methods, as described by38. Briefly, the samples were diluted in distilled water at $1 { : } 3 0 0 \\ ( \\mathrm { v / v } )$ ., a $6 0 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { L }$ aliquot was placed on a smooth carbon tape that was attached to a stub surface.

Following full droplet drying, the samples were metalized with gold using a splatter cutter, and then images were taken.\n\nKinetic stability assessment\n\nThe approach previously described by37 was utilized to measure kinetic stability.

For fifteen minutes, the nanoemulsion formulations were centrifuged at $4 0 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { r p m }$ . Freezing–thawing experiments were also used to verify the kinetic stability of the tested nano emulsions. These tests were conducted for a minimum of $2 4 \\mathrm { h }$ at two distinct temperatures $\\cdot - 2 1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and $2 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ ).\n\nZeta potential analysis\n\nElectrophoretic mobility was measured using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, Malvern-UK, 4,700 models, Germany) to calculate the zeta potential. Samples were prepared as reported by39 and distributed in a cuvette with $2 0 \\mu \\mathrm { L }$ of deionized water.\n\n\n# PH Measurement\n\nThe pH value of NEs with and without adjuvant was determined using a pH meter (Adwa—AD8000) by dipping the electrode in the sample and leaving it at room temperature for $5 ~ \\mathrm { { m i n } }$ without stirring to let the $\\mathrm { p H }$ value stabilize28.",

The adjuvant addition was found to reduce the surface tension of the Sesame, Clove, and Cinnamon nanoemulsions. When a formulation’s surface tension decreases, the area of contact increases, that causes an increase around contact between the sprayed surface and the spray, in addation improving the wetting and spreading properties.\n\nInfluence of adjuvants on Sesame, Clove, and Cinnamon nanoemulsions stability\n\nStability is a critical characteristic in nanoemulsion systems. Because nanoemulsion systems have a large surface area and small droplet sizes. Nanoemulsions’ tiny droplet size gives them stability against creaming or sedimentation due to Brownian motion, and as a result, the diffusion rate is higher than the sedimentation rate generated by gravity force (Table 1). Nanoemulsions’ stability was examined under various temperatures. The tested nanoemulsion with and without adjuvant appearance was observed formulations’ pH was in a range (4.2– 6.9), exhibited an acidic to slightly acidic except sesame (NE) with Atlox 4838B recorded (7.12). Measurements of the zeta potential in Fig. 4 showed that the nanoemulsion is homogenous. Data in Table 1 and Fig. 4 illustrated the zeta potentials for Sesame, Clove, and Cinnamon nanoemulsions with and without adjuvants within the zone of negative zeta potential. The nanoformulation of Sesame, Clove, and Cinnamon nanoemulsion alone has a zeta potential of − 31.3, − 29.2, and − $\\cdot 3 4 . 4 \\mathrm { m V } ,$ respectively.\n\nFig. 2.

This figure was drawn with GraphPad Prism 8 (9.4.1, (458) Serial number: GPS-2567891- 8A130A8A228).\n\nWhile adding adjuvant increased the value of zeta potential, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4. Particles having zeta potentials greater Values above $\\pm 3 0 ~ \\mathrm { m V }$ are regarded as stable. Because the electric charge of the droplets is large, it is reasonable to suppose that repulsive interactions between droplets exist in the nanoemulsion. A negative zeta potential value in a dispersed emulsion inhibits coagulation and coalescence by establishing repulsive forces between droplets that are greater than their attraction forces. The findings showed that the varied values and consistent distribution of the nanoformulation of sesame, clove, and cinnamon nanoemulsions with and without adjuvant indicated their stability. These results demonstrated that stability of the Sesame, Clove, and Cinnamon nanoemulsions due to the constant distribution and varying values of the nanoformulation with adjuvant.",

Droplet size and its distribution were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS), which plays a significant role in emulsion stability51,52. The tiny size of nanoemulsion is desirable for maximum efficiency. A full picture of the droplet size population and distribution in sesame (NE) and cinnamon (NE) formulations was obtained by analyzing dynamic-light-scattering (DLS) data. The average droplet size recorded the lowest value of droplet diameter size (34.09 and $3 7 . 8 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ , respectively) compared to NEs Clove (NE) was $4 2 . 5 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ . While the particle size of the sesame, cinnamon, and clove formulations with adjuvant recorded a slight increase in droplet size compared to the same formulation without adjuvant, and this hypothesis was further supported by29,53,54. Generally, all studied formulations in the range of 20 to $2 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ corresponded to the typical droplet size of O/W nanoemulsion55,56. Smaller droplet sizes in nanoemulsions will result in a stable formulation by enhancing Brownian motion and decreasing attractive forces57,58.\n\nPDI shows how homogeneous (in size) the droplets are in the formulation. It is a unitless value that ranges from 0 to $1 ^ { 5 9 }$ ; the lower the value, the more homogenous the sample. PDI values close to one indicate a heterogeneous or multimodal distribution, while values below 0.2 indicate an extremely narrow dispersion of nanoparticles and uniformity among oil droplet sizes or monomodal distributions and, consequently, better stability60. In the present study, values recorded 0.04, 0.07, and 0.05 for sesame, clove, and cinnamon, respectively; it almost monodisperses. While adding adjuvant to the nanoemulsion formulation, it recorded a slight increase in PDI than without adjuvant to become a midrange. A sample is almost monodispersed if the PDI is less than 0.08 and the midrange is between 0.08 and 0.70. The distribution algorithms perform optimally within this range61. A PDI around 1 $( > 0 . 7 )$ denotes a wide droplet size dispersion62,63.\n\nFig. 4.

This figure was drawn with GraphPad Prism 8 (9.4.1, (458) Serial number: GPS-2567891- 8A130A8A228).\n\nARGAL and Atlox 4838B adjuvants were used to optimize the viscosity of Sesame, Clove, and Cinnamon nanoemulsions, resulting in a stable formulation. Current findings are in accordance with the report of64 stated that the viscosity of the nanoemulsion formulation is around $2 7 \\mathrm { m P a } { \\cdot } \\mathrm { s } ,$ , which makes it ideal for spreading and spraying on crops. Also,28 demonstrated that neem NE combined with a botanical adjuvant can provide better adherence on applied surfaces for good bio-efficacy and long-term stability during storage. The current results indicated that if the formulation’s surface tension decreases, the area of contact will increase, in addation, caused increase the area of contact between the sprayed surface and the spray and improving the wetting and spreading properties. These justifications concur with the findings of32. Moreover65, suggest that it could result in a rise in pesticidal effectiveness. Like that observed $\\mathrm { i n } ^ { 2 8 }$ reported that low surface tension in neem NE with adjuvant allows for improved formulation spreading on brinjal leaves with high bio-efficacy in comparison to neem NE without adjuvant30,37,66.\n\nZeta potential is a crucial factor that directly influences the stability of nanoemulsions67. It gives information regarding the homogeneous behavior of the nanoemulsion. Particles having zeta potentials greater Values above $\\pm 3 0 ~ \\mathrm { m V }$ are regarded as stable. Because the electric charge of the droplets is large, it is reasonable to suppose that repulsive interactions between droplets exist in the nanoemulsion. A negative zeta potential value in a dispersed emulsion inhibits coagulation and coalescence by establishing repulsive forces between droplets that are greater than their attraction forces68. The findings showed that sesame, clove, and cinnamon nanoemulsions with adjuvant increased the value of zeta potential, then alone. Furthermore, all the zeta potentials are in the negative zone, indicating that the formulation is stable. A negative zeta potential value creates repulsive forces higher than attraction forces among droplets, preventing coagulation and coalescence in dispersion emulsion. The zeta potential measures the surface charge of the emulsion droplet, showing the physical stability of nanoformulations69. Zeta potential provides electrophoresis mobility data that is relevant to the stability of the NE formulation. A greater value suggests better nanoformulation stability due to increased droplet repulsion, which prevents coagulation and flocculation70. Based on SEM images, all investigated nanoemulsion formulations had spherical or quasi-spherical morphologies. The surface morphology and shape of all investigated nanoemulsion formulations appeared spherical or quasi-spherical, uniform, and monodispersed morphologies, and the sizes of the nanodroplets corresponded to the ones measured with DLS. Spherical forms are commonly observed in nanoemulsion pesticides71,72. The spherical shape and absence of aggregation indicate the physical stability of the nanoemulsion. This stability may be attributed to the presence of surfactant and adjuvant. In contrast, Sesame (NE) $^ +$ Atlox 4838B have a minor aggregation in the SEM image and is attributable to the sample drying process before the analysis; this is a common characteristic of emulsion systems in SEM analysis73,74. However, droplet sizes in SEM images corresponded well with those assessed by DLS. These findings are consistent with75,76, who used SEM to study the surface morphology of nanoemulsions and documented their spherical shapes. Abd El Salam et al.77 demonstrated that studies using transmission electron microscopy showed that the nanoemulsions were effectively generated at the nanoscale and mostly displayed a spherical shape. Also78, stated that the TEM examination clearly demonstrated that the nanoemulsions loaded with colistin-niclosamide were spherical, non-adhesive, non-aggregating, and equally dispersed in space; the diameters of the nanodroplets matched to those measured with DLS. The viscosity of the studied nanoemulsions without adjuvant was found to be less viscous than the tested nanoemulsions with adjuvants. The viscosity value can be influenced by the type of surfactants, organic phase constituents, and oil viscosity. Pesticide nanoemulsion has a low viscosity since it is classified as O/W with significant water loading. Nevertheless, the viscosity of nanoemulsion can be modified by surfactant concentration79.\n\nSurface tension of the developed sesame, clove, and cinnamon NE formulations by adding the adjuvant reduced the surface tension. When the surface tension of a formulation reduces, the area of contact is higher, causing an increase in the area of contact between the sprayed surface and the spray, as well as enhancing the wetting and spreading capabilities80. During this research the influence of adjuvants on Sesame, Clove, and Cinnamon nanoemulsions stability was detected. Stability is a critical characteristic in nanoemulsion systems. Nanoemulsions’ tiny droplet size gives them stability against creaming or sedimentation due to Brownian motion, and as a result, the diffusion rate is higher than the sedimentation rate generated by gravity force (see, Table 1). Comparable outcomes closely align with the conclusions of55,81,82. During the current experiment the measurements of the zeta potential showed that the nanoemulsion is homogenous. Also, these data illustrated that zeta potentials for Sesame, Clove, and Cinnamon nanoemulsions with and without adjuvants within the zone of negative zeta potential. The results demonstrated the stability of the sesame, clove, and cinnamon nanoemulsions because of the constant distribution and varying values of the nanoformulation with adjuvant. These findings concur with a prior study by83,84.\n\nThe $\\mathrm { p H }$ value acts as a stabilizing indicator for nanoemulsions, depending on the surface properties of the droplet. In our finding, it was observed that the $\\mathrm { p H }$ of all tested formulations with and without adjuvant exhibited an acidic to slightly acidic $\\mathrm { p H }$ except sesame (NE) with Atlox 4838B exhibited neutral pH. In the current investigation, the adjuvant was shown to slightly enhance the pH value and stabilize it, hence reducing the degradation of the tested formulation. The obtained results were confirmed by 28 who found that using a botanical adjuvant stabilizes the $\\mathrm { p H }$ to slightly acidic to prevent neem NE from degrading while being stored. Previous research has shown that excessive alkalinity or acidity in nanoformulations degrades the active component, reducing the formulation’s bioefficacy85. In another study, it was found that changing pH aggregates and destabilizes nanoemulsions during storage86. Abd El Salam et al.77 found that frankincense, turmeric, and sesame NE formulations had a slightly acidic $\\mathrm { p H }$ , which is typical of stable nanoemulsions.\n\nThe insecticidal activity of enhancement clove, cinnamon, and sesame NE against rice weevils, S. oryzae, as shown in the results that adding Calcium Alkyl Benzene Sulphonate (Atlox 4838B) adjuvant to clove, cinnamon, and sesame NE performed higher toxicity against the rice weevils, S. oryzae, after a 27-h exposure period than other formulations. Also in the mortality rate, the results of $1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { l }$ treatment of Clove, Cinnamon, and Sesame NE with Atlox 4838B adjuvant have higher mortality rates, followed by Cinnamon, Sesame, and Clove NE with ARGAL adjuvant after the $^ { 7 2 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ of contact test than those of Cinnamon, Clove, and Sesame NE alone in $1 0 \\mu \\mathrm { l }$ treatment. However, the above-mentioned results conform with the findings of a lot of scientists on various nano formulations and adjuvants; furthermore28, reported that neem nano-emulsion with botanical adjuvant provided long-term storage stability as well as better adhesiveness and wetting with lower surface tension, as well as neem NE with adjuvant showed remarkable insecticidal effectiveness against whitefly. Furthermore29, found that adding adjuvants to olibanum NE improved stability and lowered contact angle and surface tension more effectively than olibanum NE alone. Additionally, the olibanum NE, with or without adjuvants, was the most effective chemical against the 2nd instar larvae of the spiny bollworm Earias insulana. Furthermore30, demonstrated that the solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) of citronella oil combined with three adjuvants increased the toxicity and mortality percentage of Spodoptera littoralis larvae, as well as stability, more than the nanoformulation alone. Also, chemical pesticides such as abamectin, lambda-cyhalothrin, imidaclopride, emamectin benzoate, and oxamyl were shown to be more effective and to have longer-lasting effects when PEG 600 di-oleate adjuvants were added32. Adjuvants improved the efficacy of lambda-cyhalothrin formulations, according to34 . Consequently, the number of treatments each season and the pace at which pesticides are applied can both be decreased by using adjuvants.",

    "content": "# Conclusions\n\nThe current research focused on using nanoemulsions to create lipophilic active-loaded products for pesticide application to develop a green efficient, and stable pesticide formulation. During this experiment, certain nano emulsions nemaly, Calcium Alkyl Benzene Sulphonate (Atlox 4838B), and non-ionic surfactant based on trisiloxane ethoxylate (ARGAL), were tested against S. oryzae. Current results showed that all formulation were penal, achieving nanometric size for all compounds. The bioassay test $( \\mathrm { L C } _ { 5 0 } )$ values for S. oryzae adults indicated that Clove, Sesame, and Cinnamon nano emulsions with Atolx adjuvants were the most effective under laboratory conditions, where the $\\mathrm { L C } _ { 5 0 }$ values were 0.022, 0.032 and $\\mathrm { 0 . 0 3 5 ~ \\mu L } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ respectively after $^ { 2 7 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ . Clove, Cinnamon, and Sesame nanoemulsion (NE) with $0 . 0 1 \\%$ (w/w) adjuvant exhibited remarkable insecticidal activity against S. oryzae L., of 100, 100 and $9 7 . 5 \\%$ respectively by in vitro assay. These two categories of adjuvants enhanced the spray performance, maximum retention, enhanced bioavailability, and control impact by improving the viscosity, surface tension, and water dispersibility. The suspension that was created with Atlox 4838B outperformed the others in terms of wettability, surface tension, and S. oryzae control. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) revealed that the particle size was nanometrically created, whereas SEM revealed that the studied NE formulations, both with and without adjuvants, primarily had spherical or quasi-spherical morphologies. The particles ranged in width from 20 to $1 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ . Whereas for NE, a polydispersity was almost monodispersed. While the NE formulation becomes a midrange when an adjuvant is added. Using the exception of sesame (NE) using AtloxTM 4838B, which showed neutral, the $\\mathrm { p H }$ ranged from 4.27 to 6.96, suggesting an acidic to mildly acidic $\\mathrm { p H }$ . Compared to the studied nanoemulsions with adjuvants, the viscosity of the nanoemulsions without adjuvants was lower. There is no phase separation, creaming, or crystallization in the kinetically stable nanoemulsion. For sesame, clove, and cinnamon nanoemulsions with adjuvant, a negative zeta potential value raised the value of zeta potential compared to when used alone. Additionally, the adjuvant decreased the NE formulations’ surface tension.\n\n\n# Data availability\n\nThe datasets generated or analyzed during the current study are available on reasonable request by the Corresponding author(s): mazennour2@yahoo.com (M.I.M).\n\nReceived: 9 June 2024; Accepted: 18 December 2024   \nPublished online: 07 January 2025\n\n\n# References\n\n\n1.

Although a number of occupational and non-occupational situations affect the extent and route of exposure to pesticides, most skin effects are associated with a relatively small number of compounds. The highest exposures and risk of dermatitis involve individuals employed in agricultural pest control operations. The degree of pesticide contact may be lessened by use of protective clothing and engineering controls such as closed mixing and loading systems.\n\nFor evaluating the effects of pesticides on the skin, the most relevant tests include dermal absorption tests, the 72 hr. Draize dermal irritation study, and sensitization studies. For the Draize irritancy test, a general protocol utilizing albino rabbits is provided. Suggested concentrations are also given for sensitization studies using the patch test methodology.\n\nRegistries for monitoring pesticide-related illness exist in numerous US and worldwide jurisdictions. The most complete historical data derive from the California Pesticide Illness\n\nSurveillance Program. This chapter briefly presents data on illnesses associated with individual classes of pesticides and pesticide mixtures, discussed separately as five categories (antimicrobials, fumigants, fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides), focusing on the principal causes of pesticide dermatitis reported in medical literature and in California use and surveillance data between 1982 and 2014.\n\n\n# Keywords\n\nPesticide $\\cdot$ Agrochemical $\\cdot$ Agriculture · Exposure $\\cdot$ Dermatitis $\\cdot$ Sensitization $\\cdot$ Allergy/ allergic $\\cdot$ Irritant $\\cdot$ Contact $\\cdot$ ACD $\\cdot$ ICD · Antimicrobial $\\cdot$ Insecticide $\\cdot$ Fumigant $\\cdot$ Fungicide $\\cdot$ Herbicide $\\cdot$ Patch test",

    "content": "# 2 Introduction\n\nPesticides include chemicals as well as biological and physical agents used to control a diverse array of pests. As of 2024, the state of California has registered 1057 pesticide active ingredients (AIs) formulated into 13,071 separate products, including adjuvants and antimicrobial compounds (DPR 2024). Adjuvants must be registered as pesticides in California but are exempt from federal registration requirements. Both state and federal regulatory agencies classify antimicrobial compounds as pesticides, although many clinicians do not naturally regard them as such.\n\nThe most recent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report on pesticide sales and usage (U.S. EPA 2024), based on data sources for 2008 and 2012, estimated annual world pesticide usage totaling nearly 6 billion pounds in 2012, with herbicides accounting for almost half of global usage, followed by fumigants, insecticides, and fungicides. Pesticide use in the USA totaled over 1 billion pounds in 2012 (Table 1). The survey did not include antimicrobial agents, which historically accounts for half of the pesticides sold and taxed in California (980,637,605 pounds, based on 2015 sales data) (DPR 2015a). If antimicrobial use in California can be extrapolated to account for a similar proportion of the USA, the national total would be more than 2 billion pounds annually.\n\nThe long list of pesticide agents can best be understood by grouping them into target pest or use categories and then by chemical structure (Table 2). Most skin effects of pesticides are associated with a relatively small number of compounds. These include the fumigant compounds (metam-sodium and methyl bromide), selected fungicides (conazoles, phthalimide, thiocarbamate, copper salts, elemental sulfur, organotins, naphthenate salts, and halogenated nitrile benzene compounds), halogenated organophosphates (dichlorvos and naled), pyrethroids, and bipyridyl herbicides.\n\nTable 1 Amount of pesticide active ingredient used by pesticide type   \n\n<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Year andpesticidetype</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Worldmarket(billionpounds)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>US market(billionpounds)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>US %worldmarket</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2006</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Herbicidesa</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.018</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.498</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>25</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Insecticides</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.955</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.099</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Fungicides</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.519</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.073</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>14</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Otherb</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.705</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.457</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>27</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Total</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.197</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.127</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>22</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2009</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Herbicidesa</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.189</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.498</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>25</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Insecticides</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.016</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.099</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Fungicides</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.784</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.073</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>14</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Fumigants</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.019</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.457</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>27</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Totalc</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.008</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.127</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>22</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2012</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Herbicidesa</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>2.847</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.678</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>24</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Insecticides</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.065</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.064</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Fungicides</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.799</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.105</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>13</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Fumigants</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.110</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>0.435</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>39</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Totalc</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>5.821</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>1.182</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>20</td></tr></table>\n\nNevertheless, in field investigations of current pesticide illness episodes, compounds with novel chemical structures and different modes of action are sometimes implicated. These novel pesticide groups may be unfamiliar to many clinicians. Many of these compounds have selective or relatively selective modes of action and a very limited number of illness reports and no indication that they cause dermatitis (Table 3). For example, the compound spinosad (Kirst 2010) fits this safety profile. As a selective nicotine receptor inhibitor, spinosad was initially registered for turf and ornamental crops in 1997, but now has agricultural uses. Also, the chitin synthesis inhibitor novaluron, initially registered in 2008, has a low overall mammalian toxicity and negative tests for dermal irritation and sensitivity.\n\nTable 2 Active ingredients of pesticides registered in California, July 2017   \n\n<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Use category</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1># of AIs</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Structural categories</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Antimicrobial bactericidedisinfectant virucide</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>21321517273</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Alcohol, isothiazilone (Kathon) compounds, thiocarbamate salts, phenols,quaternary ammonium, aldehydes, carboxylic acid, chlorine, chlorinereleasers, biological preparations, calcium salts, epoxides, coppercompounds, iodines, hydantoin compounds, peroxides, silver compounds,bromide salts, silicates, morpholine derivatives, organotin compounds,chelating agents, bacteriophages</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Avicide</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Pyrimidinol, chloro-toluidine, aminopyridine</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Fumigant</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>12</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Halonitromethane, low molecular weight halogenated hydrocarbons,phosphine, phosphine releasers, MITC releasers</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Fungicide</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>316</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Carbamate, phthalimido compounds, thiocarbamate, biological agents</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Herbicide</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>186</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Triazines, thiocarbamates, bipiridyls, pyridinecarboxylic acid, acetanilide,amide, ammonium salt, urea compounds, thiourea compounds, arseniccompounds, sulfonamide, biological, boron, phenoxy compounds,cyclohexanedione, dimethoxypyrimidine, dintiroanilines, imidazolinone</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Insecticide</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>258</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Organophosphate, carbamates, pyrethrins/pyrethroids, biological,pyrethroids</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Insect growth regulator</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>44</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Methoprene analogs</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Molluscicide</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>33</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Aldehydes</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Nematicide</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>25</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Biological, phosphonothionate, biological</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Plant growth regulator</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>55</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Triazol, acetamide, alkyl ammonium, vinylglycine, fatty acid, fluorenederivative, furan derivative, hexadione, hydrazide, indole derivative,inorganic cyanamide, phenylamine,phenylurea, phosphonic acid,piperidinium, pyrimidine, low molecular weight unsaturated organiccompound, naphthalene derivative</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Repellent</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>77</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Plant oil extracts, isothiocyanates, mercaptans, ammonium derivatives,coyote and fox urine granules, ketones, piperidine, egg proteins, toluamidederivatives, biological oils</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Vertebrate control</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>37</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Warfarin derivative, phosphide salt, biological alkaloid, cyanide salt,vitamin D derivative, inorganic nitrate salt, rotenone, anthranilate</td></tr></table>",

Prior to the enactment of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) in 1970, there was little regulation and testing of pesticides in the USA. Since the enactment of FIFRA, the U.S. EPA has applied an increasingly strict testing scheme to registration for sale and use of pesticides. The data required by the U.S. EPA for registration of a pesticide include product chemistry, environmental fate, acute and chronic toxicology, and studies of hazards to nontarget organisms.\n\nPesticide materials tested in animal studies may include pure AI, technical grade AI, or individual product formulations. Solvents, surfactants, and preservatives in product formulations may affect the results of both irritation and sensitization tests in animals. This observation parallels clinical experience with patch testing showing paraben and other preservatives as the underlying cause of sensitization for many different commercial products.",

The vapor pressure and other physicochemical properties (especially photoreactivity and photostability, which can be of significance for photopatch testing) of individual compounds also affect the degree of inhalation or skin contact. For compounds that may cause systemic allergy or other generalized skin eruptions, the degree of dermal absorption is also important. A high percentage of pesticides are absorbed across intact human skin because of a combination of relatively low molecular weight and high lipid solubility. This correlates with the requirement for many of these compounds to be absorbed through the protective coverings of insects or plants.\n\nTable 3 New/selective pesticide chemistry   \n\n<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Chemical category: mechanism of action</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Dermal irritation/sensitization; illness data for typicalcompound(s)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Insecticides</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Pheromones, biological insecticides</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>(S)-verbenone—Bark beetle antiaggregation pheromone;94.8% concentration, nonirritant in the Draize assay,sensitizer in the Buehler Guinea pig test; registered in 2012,no reported illnesses</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Insect growth regulators (mimicking natural juvenilehormone)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Methoprene—Animal irritation studies show reversal(moderate-minimal) irritation; no cases associated withisolated exposure to methoprene were reported since initialregistration in the 1980s</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Neonicotinoids (differential effect oninsect vs. mammalian nicotine receptors)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Imidacloprid—Minimal irritation in animal studies;nonsensitizer in Buehler test, GPMT; five illnesses reportedsince initial registration 1998, including 2 cases followingdirect accidental contact</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Chitin synthesis inhibitors</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Novaluron—a category IV (minimal) irritant in Draize test;nonsensitizer in Buehler test; no illnesses reported sinceinitial registration 2006</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Tetronic acid inhibitors (inhibits lipid synthesis)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Spirotetramat—One possible case, with only indirectcontact, reported since initial registration in 2008</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ryanodine receptor modulators (differential effect oninsect muscle receptor)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Chlorantraniliprole—96.5% technical material nonirritant inDraize test; nonsensitizer in the GPMT; no reported illnesssince initial registration in 2008</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Spinosyns (selective nicotine receptor binders,extracted from Saccaropolyspora spinosa and semi-synthetic derivatives)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Spinosad—Negative irritation and sensitization studies;limited illness reported in 19 years of use</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Triazine insecticides</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Pymetrozine—Mode of action not definitively known; 50%wettable granule minimal irritant</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Fungicides</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Benzamidoximes (inhibit fungal colony formation)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cyflufenamid—10% suspension minimal irritant, negative inGPMT; no reported illnesses since initial registration in 2012</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Biologicals</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Pseudomonas syringae—Minimal irritant in Draize test; nosensitization studies</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Carboxamide (selectively concentrates in fungal cells;inhibits succinic dehydrogenase)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Iprodione—75% granules moderate irritant; three liquids,(23% AI, 41.6% AI, 19% iprodione-20.4% thiophanate-methyl), 50% granular product caused minimal irritation;dermatitis cases with direct accidental exposure</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Strobilurin (inhibits fungal mitochondrial respiration)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Azoxystrobin—Category IV (minimal) irritant in Draizetest; nonsensitizer in Buehler test; limited illness reports</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Herbicides</td><td></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Carotenoid synthesis inhibitors</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Norflurazon—5% granules, 99.6% solid minimal irritants;nonsensitizer in LLNA; one possible case of dermatitis;sensitization reported since registration in the 1980s</td></tr></table>\n\nThe highest exposures and risk of dermatitis involve individuals employed in agricultural pest control operations: mixing, loading, applying, and flagging. These workers are often grouped under the category of “pesticide handlers.” Mixers and loaders may handle concentrated pesticides in large volumes. The degree of contact may be lessened by use of protective clothing and equipment, closed mixing and loading systems, or use of water-soluble bags. Exposure to applicators varies with the type of application, from backpack sprayers to enclosed-cab vehicles with filtered cooled air.

Extensive contact with contaminated equipment may be involved during unscheduled maintenance such as with breakdowns or leaks. In production facilities, exposures may be much higher if dusts, powders, or granules are processed in open systems.\n\nIssues arise in the agricultural work environments that do not occur in the industrial setting because of the widely scattered seasonal labor force. Hazards are transient and may be difficult to evaluate after the fact. For the workers, supervisors, and ranch operators living on farm properties, there is also a very limited division between work and living space. Unexpected hazards include intermittent presence of pesticide residues or pesticide application equipment in children’s play areas or exposures due to pesticide drift (where airborne pesticide applications to one field may inadvertently disperse to adjacent fields or residential areas), and accidental intrusion of soil-applied nematicides and fumigants into well water. Pesticide levels in house dust have also been associated with the “take home” exposure scenario where pesticide residues are transferred from the workplace to home via work clothing, shoes, vehicles, and tools.",

    "content": "# 2.3 Pesticide-Dermatitis Surveillance\n\nRegistries for monitoring pesticide-related illness exist in numerous US (NIOSH 2017) and worldwide jurisdictions. The most complete historical data derive from the California Pesticide Illness Surveillance Program (PISP). The registry began as collections of newspaper clippings in the 1930s. It was operated by the California Department of Food and Agriculture beginning in the 1970s and has been operated by the California Environmental Protection Agency since 1991. The electronic database in its current form dates to 1992. Data collected between 1982 and 1991 are still available electronically but have not been completely re-coded according to the current system. Data for this time period serve as a valuable reference point for evaluating dermatitis trends. Several large-scale episodes have also proved important in understanding the role of slow environmental dissipation for key irritant materials causing dermatitis in field workers (Smith 1991; Saunders et al. 1987; O’Malley et al. 1990).\n\nOther US states registering pesticide illnesses currently include Washington, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, and Washington (NIOSH 2017). The largest volume of cases, approximately 100 annually, come from Texas and Washington. Specific data on skin effects are not presented in the summary data available.\n\nThe completeness of illness reporting has been controversial. Underreporting may be especially frequent for skin reactions that do not result in time lost from work. Grouping of cases in clusters, on the other hand, demonstrably increases illness reporting in the affected group. Interviewing coworkers of an index case in a group with similar exposures typically reveal cases who never sought treatment. It is unknown whether factors affecting reporting have significantly changed over time, accounting for apparent variations in population incidence.\n\nFigure 1 shows trends in cases of pesticiderelated dermatitis reported in California between 1982 and 2014. There were a total of 9763 cases reported in that interval. During the mid-1980s, episodes of dermatitis in agricultural workers accounted for 300–400 cases annually but have accounted for 100 or fewer cases in the years since 2000. Possible explanations for the decreasing number of cases since 2000 include changes in pesticide regulations, pesticide use, work practices, and illness reporting.\n\nFig. 1 Pesticide dermatitis cases in California 1982–2014\n\nFig. 2 Propargite and sulfur use in California 1990–2015\n\nClusters identified by assigned reference case numbers accounted for $2 5 \\%$ of the total cases. Years with unusually high-percentage cluster cases included 1986 (122 cases in orange harvesters associated with propargite residue), 1988 (47 cases in nectarine harvesters also associated with propargite), and 1991 (100 cases in workers cleaning up a metam-sodium spill in the Sacramento River).\n\nA 1980s requirement for formulation of propargite in water-soluble bags had a definite impact on the number of cases of eye irritation and dermatitis in mixing and loading operations. The long re-entry interval for propargite set in the early 1990s provides an example of a regulation, possibly accounting for the subsequent decline in large-scale field residue dermatitis episodes (refer to examples above). An episode did subsequently occur in 1995, but may have been caused by an over-application of the AI. Overall use of propargite has declined since the 1990s but did not decline significantly until many years after the long re-entry interval took effect. The long re-entry time may have impacted the timing of work practices, so that exposure was limited to performing hand-labor tasks prior to application rather than afterward. Over the same period, use of sulfur changed only slightly (Fig. 2).\n\nA gradual increase in the percentage of agricultural workers employed by farm labor contractors (as opposed to being directly employed by growing operations) has been noted in California since the 1980s (Fig. 3). It is conjectured that this arrangement may discourage reporting of workrelated illnesses and injuries. Episodes of retaliation against employees making workers’ compensation claims make this seem plausible, but it is difficult to ascertain how frequently this may occur. The overall low percentage of farmworkers with employer-provided health insurance means many seek care at overburdened safety-net clinics. The lack of routine access to care may also decrease the likelihood of seeking treatment for workplace injuries and illnesses.\n\n\n# 3 Pesticide-Related Dermatitis\n\nThe following sections briefly present data on illnesses associated with individual classes of pesticides and pesticide mixtures, discussed separately as five categories: antimicrobials, fumigants, fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides.",

    "content": "# 3.1 Irritant Versus Allergic Contact Dermatitis\n\nSurveillance data do not inherently distinguish between allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) or other skin effects of pesticides. However, since allergic dermatitis is characteristically idiosyncratic, clusters usually involve irritant dermatitis affecting a group of field workers performing a common work task. Most dermatitis cases in pesticide handlers are probably also due to irritation, but occur singly and may require diagnostic patch testing to rule out ACD in some circumstances. ICD is also known to predispose patients to developing ACD (Nosbaum et al. 2009).\n\nFig. 3 Farm labor contractor (FLC) employment as a percentage of total California agricultural Employment 1991–2016\n\nICD is a nonimmunological reaction caused by direct damage to the skin following exposure to an agrochemical or other harmful agent. Immune response and resulting inflammation is secondary to the cutaneous damage. Some agents do cause subjective skin symptoms while producing minimal inflammation by stimulating the cutaneous nerves. Corrosive substances, such as strong acids and alkalis, are examples of immediate irritants that produce skin damage within minutes or hours of exposure. Cumulative irritation is more subtle, resulting from exposure to an inherently less irritating material or a dilute concentration of a severely irritating or corrosive substance. Because of the delay between initial contact and the subsequent response, the specific cause of cumulative irritation may prove difficult to recognize.\n\nWith ACD, an immunological reaction is triggered by dermal contact to a skin allergen. After sensitization, subsequent exposures may elicit an immunological reaction. This response may occur at the site of contact but may also occur systemically. Once individuals are sensitized to a pesticide, exposure to even minute amounts of the chemical may cause a reaction.\n\nClinical history and examination can provide some help in differentiating ICD and ACD. Common reaction patterns and primary morphologies of pesticide contact dermatitis include papules, plaques, macules, patches, vesiculobullous, as well as nail plate changes. The nails in particular are frequently affected (likely due to handling of the chemicals) and include nail discoloration, onycholysis, and other nail dystrophies. (Febriana et al. 2023). Secondary changes such as fissuring, ulceration, as well as post-inflammatory pigmentary changes do occur. Like all inflammatory dermatoses, particular attention should be given to patients with skin of color as pigmentary changes are frequent and more pronounced. When clinical symptoms and findings overlap between ICD and ACD, patch testing is often useful and may also identify confounding allergies to plants or protein contact dermatitis. Penagos et al. (2004) have emphasized the need to test agricultural workers with specific pesticide patch test series. California illness registry records seldom contain information about testing with either the standard patch test series or specific pesticide or plant allergens. Exceptions included occasional published case reports (Dannaker et al. 1993) or patch test studies of reported cases (O’Malley et al. 1995) and a patch test performed by a rural dermatologist.\n\nOne of the key problems that became apparent as patch testing proliferated was that different investigators were using different concentrations, vehicles, and, in some cases, chemicals to detect a given allergy. In recognition of the need to standardize patch testing, the Scandinavian Committee for Standardization of Routine Patch Testing was created in 1962. The International Contact Dermatitis Research Group (ICDRG) was later formed in 1967, followed by the North American Contact Dermatitis Group (NACDG), which was modeled after the ICDRG. By patch testing using standardized procedures with the same screening allergens, long-term trends in patch test reactions may be analyzed. Lachapelle (1997) produced an original coding system $\\mathrm { ~  ~ { ~ \\cal ~ O ~ } ~ } = \\mathrm { ~  ~ n o ~ }$ relevance/not traced, $1 =$ doubtful relevance, $2 =$ possible relevance, $3 =$ likely relevance) for recording clinical results of patch tests, grading relevance to the current and past clinical condition of tested patients. The Lachapelle coding system may prove helpful in reviewing results of patch testing series involving exposed workers with no current skin condition but a history of prior occupational exposure (O’Malley et al. 1995; Verma et al. 2007; Sharma and Kaur 1990). Positive test results in these cases would be graded as having no current relevance, but possible past relevance. In typical case reports, positive reactions have obvious current relevance (Dannaker et al. 1993).",

Draize dermal irritation study, and sensitization studies. For the Draize irritancy test, a general protocol utilizing albino rabbits is as follows (O’Malley 2010).

Solid materials are moistened with distilled water, saline, or other vehicle at the time of application. The irritation is scored at intervals until the irritation has resolved or is considered permanent. Materials are categorized based on scores at $^ { 7 2 \\mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ and persistence of irritation for more than 14 days (Table 5).

The U.S. EPA does not require changes in the label signal word for formulations that cause sensitization in predictive testing but does require use of appropriate cautionary statements (e.g., “Prolonged or frequently repeated skin contact may cause allergic reactions in some individuals”) (U.S. EPA 2013).

    "content": "# 3.4 Dermal Manifestation of Systemic Absorption\n\nTypified by the cholinesterase inhibitors, many dermally absorbed pesticides have systemic effects. In relatively few cases, the systemic effects manifest themselves with skin eruptions. Examples include urticaria or drug-like eruptions resulting from absorbed AIs or their metabolites. Notable examples are organophosphates that cause both contact irritation and cholinesterase irritation (Mathias 1983).\n\nresult from disinfectants used to clean equipment or directly on udders prior to milking. Equipment disinfectants include sodium hydroxide and nitric acid. Dairy farmers are also exposed to hypochlorite iodine, phenolic compounds, and quaternary ammonium compounds. Preservative solutions for milk sample analysis in the UK have contained $8 \\%$ bronopol and $20 \\%$ methyl-chloroisothiazoline and methylisothiazoline or methyisothiazolinone (KathonR CG), with antibacterial and fungicidal properties. Bronopol is currently registered in California and the USA as an antimicrobial, fungicide, and algaecide/slimicide. Primarily used as a preservative and a microbiocide in the processing of industrial water, it has also been used in seed treatment and foliar spray in some countries. ACDs have been identified in workers exposed to bronopol and KathonR CG as milk preservatives.",

    "content": "# 4 Antimicrobials\n\nThe compounds discussed below account for a substantial portion of all reported cases of dermatitis associated with antimicrobials. Frequently reported classes of antimicrobials included quaternary ammonium compounds, isothiazoline (Kathon) compounds, chlorine and hypochlorites, the chlorine releaser cyanuric acid, glutaraldehyde, phenolic disinfectants, pine oil, and creosote (Table 7). All of the agents have the capacity to cause significant irritation or corrosion. Glutaraldehyde, the isothiazioline compounds, and quaternary ammonium compounds, as discussed below, can also cause sensitization.\n\nDairy workers typify the risk antimicrobials may pose to agricultural workers. ICD or ACD may\n\nQuaternary ammonium compounds (quaternary ammonium salts) or “Quats” contain a central nitrogen with two short-chain (usually methyl or ethyl) and long-chain alkyl groups of varying length substituted for the hydrogens in the ammonium atom. Commercial products contain mixtures of multiple compounds. The variation in chain length affects the activity against specific bacterial or viral pathogens (Anderson et al. 2016).\n\nThe 1982–2014 registry data showed 499 reported cases of dermatitis associated with quaternary ammonium compounds (grouping all registered products) and an additional 148 involving mixtures of quaternary ammonium compounds with other products. The large majority affected those directly handling the products. A total of 408 of the quats cases involved only dermatitis; 52 involved skin and eye symptoms;\n\n<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=7>Taaspeceelate0eleialanticieeiinsecticides</td></tr><tr><td

to quats. Animal studies on quaternary ammonium compounds show that concentrations greater than $5 \\%$ can cause irritation in the Draize assay. Occupational allergic contact dermatitis from 2,3-epoxypropyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (EPTMAC) and Kathon LX have been reported. Positive patch test reactions to various quats have been reported. Asthma and other respiratory conditions associated with quaternary ammonium cleaning products are also reported in the public domain literature.\n\nCreosote has had a long history of use as a wood preservative, but has been replaced by alternative products containing copper, chromium, or synthetic organic compounds. In addition to ICD, literature reports on creosote include cases of ICD, ACD, and squamous cell cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified creosote as a probable human carcinogen based on a very large number of case reports as well as clear evidence of carcinogenicity in animals (IARC 2017).\n\nGlutaraldehyde is principally used as a medical disinfectant. Public literature on glutaraldehyde contains numerous reports of irritant and allergic dermatitis, as well as cases of related irritant or allergic occupational asthma, chiefly in medical personnel.\n\nHypochlorites and other chlorine-based antimicrobials account for a large percentage of overall pesticide use on account of reported industrial sales. Hypochlorite products have been reported to cause severe irritation in the Draize assay. Triazine derivatives, used to prevent photodegredation of chlorine in pools and water treatment systems, also have extensive use and marked irritant properties. One such triazine derivative is cyanuric acid.\n\nSensitization to hypochlorite has been reported in the form of contact urticarial (Hostynek et al. 1989). Nevertheless, most sodium hypochloritecontaining antimicrobials are not labeled as sensitizers. Although testing with the Buehler and guinea pig maximization protocols did not show evidence of sensitization. No sensitization study on cyanuric acid was available for review. Irritant dermatitis associated with hypochlorite is a frequent occurrence. In cases with breakdown of the epidermis, sensitization may occur (Hostynek et al. 1989).\n\nPhenolic disinfectants include 173 different chemical codes, many with numerous inactive and no active registrations. These include noteworthy agents such as tert-butyl-phenol, a sensitizer and a classic cause of occupational leukoderma, and the chloracnegens 2,4,5-trichlorophenol and pentachlorophenol. Hexachlorophene is no longer registered but has been reported to cause sensitization (Praditsuwan et al. 1995), occupational asthma (Nagy and Orosz 1984), and neurotoxicity (Shuman et al. 1974; Rose et al. 1975; McCarl 1975; Ramu et al. 2016). Formerly registered dinitrophenol compounds, used as herbicides, uncouple oxidative phosphorylation; during the 1940s, they were prescribed as weight loss agents, but were associated with the occurrence of cataracts.",

These chemicals are often used as fragrances in cleaning products as they have been shown to have activity against $S .$ . aureus and Aspergillus (Vieira-Brock et al. 2017). These terpenes, much like citronella, are also used as insect repellents (Lee 2018). Given the natural occurrence of limonene and linalool in plants, the source of exposure would likely be from plants in an agricultural setting and from cleaning or pesticide commercial products in the industrial setting. Oxidation of limonene and linalool leads to hydroperoxide formation with both the potential for ICD and ACD (Ogueta et al. 2022; Schubert et al. 2023). In a retrospective patch testing study of 5773 patients, the prevalence rates of contact allergy to oxidized linalool and limonene were $7 . 0 \\%$ and $5 . 1 \\%$ respectively (Sukakul et al. 2022).\n\nPine oil is a mixture of terpenes produced by the high-temperature distillation of oil of turpentine residues or by the catalytic hydration of pinenes. It contains tertiary and secondary cyclic terpene alcohols, varying with the source of turpentine and the production method. Pine oil has potential systemic toxicity on ingestion due to its content of isopropanol. Sensitization may be due to the multiple terpene alcohols in the distillate.",

    "content": "# 4.2 Isothiazoline Compounds\n\nIsothiazoline compounds are used as biocides for disinfection. The illness registry categorizes isothiazolones as Kathon or “isothiazoline disinfectants.” The 1982–2014 data identified 35 cases of dermatitis associated with Kathon or as isothiazoline, cases principally occurring in handlers (Table 7). Numerous reports in public domain literature document the capacity of isothiazolines to sensitize. Cases of occupational ACD to octhilinone used as a fungicide for surface paint of roof sheets, for workers in paint manufacturing, and farm workers have been reported. Recent articles have noted multiple cases of sensitization related to isothiazoline preservatives (Kathon CG) used in makeup and other skin care products, with clusters of cases from the Czech Republic, Belgium, France, Spain, and Brazil. Isothiazoline compounds used as preservatives in formulations can also cause sensitization, sometimes mistakenly attributed to the formulation AI (refer to glyphosate discussion).\n\nOcthilinone, an isothiazoline compound, has registered uses as a microbiocide, algicide, or fungicide. As a biocide, it is used in industrial processes and water systems. Octhilinone is also used as a preservative in paint, adhesives, and plastics, to control sapstain and mold on wood, as a treatment for textiles, and even in shampoos and cosmetics. This does not include cutting oils and other industrial fluids.\n\nEthylene oxide (also known as epoxy ethane) is used as a fumigant and a sterilant. Ethylene oxide, first used as an agricultural fumigant in 1928, is effective against all microorganisms. In California, ethylene oxide is registered for commercial and institutional uses. In these settings (hospitals, nursing homes, and veterinary clinics), ethylene oxide is used to sterilize medical equipment sensitive to heat sterilization.\n\nPublic domain literature includes reports of severe irritant dermatitis and chemical burns from direct skin contact with ethylene oxide consistent with cases reported to the California registry. Animal studies strongly suggest that ethylene oxide is carcinogenic. Multiple studies have produced limited evidence of elevated human cancer rates. Some studies showed a mildly increased risk of breast cancer and evidence of a dose– response effect (Steenland et al. 2004; Mikoczy et al. 2011).\n\nMethyl bromide (bromomethane) is a broadspectrum fumigant used as an acaricide, antimicrobial, fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, nematicide, and vertebrate control agent. It has been used for insect control in grain elevators, mills, ships, and greenhouses. It has also been used as a postharvest treatment of commodities. The most prevalent use for methyl bromide is as a preplant fumigant, injected into the soil at various depths. Use for structural fumigation is now prohibited. Under the Clean Air Act and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, US production and import of methyl bromide has been banned as of January 1, 2005, except for critical use exemptions.",

    "content": "# 5 Fumigants\n\nFumigants produce gas, vapor fumes, or smoke intended to destroy insects, bacteria, or rodents. They may be volatile liquids and solids as well as substances already gaseous. They may be used for structural pest control, or to disinfect materials that can be enclosed to contain the fumigant. In California, a primary use of fumigants is on strawberry, carrot, and tomato fields.\n\nSoil fumigants typically pose potential risks to those involved in the application or perform work following the application of these chemicals. There may also be a potential risk of eye and respiratory irritation for those who reside near fumigant-treated fields (O’Malley et al. 2005). Cases of dermatitis associated with select fumigants are shown in Table 7.\n\nMethyl bromide causes corrosion in the Draize assay. The public domain literature on methyl bromide contains many reports on burns from methyl bromide. In many instances, the topical exposure was associated with systemic absorption and neurological symptoms.\n\nDichloropropene and ethylene dibromide (EDB), like methyl bromide, are volatile, lowmolecular-weight alkylhalogen compounds with high systemic toxicity. EDB was canceled during the 1980s because of concern about its carcinogenicity in rodent bioassays and widespread contamination of groundwater. Prior to the\n\nNo animal sensitization studies were available for review, but the products registered in California are labeled as sensitizers.\n\nMethyl iodide (iodomethane) has been used as an intermediate in the manufacture of some pharmaceuticals and pesticides. Although approved in 2010, methyl iodide is no longer registered as a pesticidal AI with the state of California. Preplant fumigant uses of methyl iodide are proposed to replace those of methyl bromide. It had limited use in 2012, before registration was canceled by the registrant in March 2012.\n\nMetam sodium and metam potassium are broad-spectrum soil fumigants with fungicidal, insecticidal, nematocidal, herbicidal, and antimicrobial properties. Metam fumigants are registered as agricultural soil fumigants for use on all food, feed, and fiber crops. They are also registered as antimicrobial agents, used to treat wooden poles, timbers, sewage sludge, and animal waste. Restricted uses of metam sodium include uses as a root control agent in sewers and drains. As either the potassium or sodium salt, metam rapidly degrades to methylisothiocyanate (MITC) in the environment, particularly in the presence of moisture. MITC is a highly volatile compound responsible for the biocidal properties of metam fumigants. MITC itself is registered as an antimicrobial agent for wood poles and pilings.\n\nCases of contact dermatitis associated with metam sodium have been reported in several jurisdictions around the world. Current problems with metam-sodium involve environmental exposures from off-site movement. Typical events involve multiple cases, with predominantly eye, respiratory and systemic symptoms, rather than contact dermatitis (O’Malley et al. 2004, 2005).\n\nDazomet, like metam-sodium, breaks down to release MITC, but is typically formulated in a granular form that allows low-volume preplant treatment of ornamental beds. When dazomet is applied to soil, it quickly breaks down to its major degradant, MITC, but formaldehyde, monomethylamine, hydrogen sulfide, and (in acid soils) carbon disulfide are also formed. Contact cancelation, it was used as a broad-spectrum fumigant in a manner similar to current use of dermatitis, both irritant and allergic, has been reported to dazomet in the public domain literature.\n\nChloropicrin used in concentrations greater than $2 \\%$ is considered an active biocidal ingredient rather than a warning agent. Similar to other fumigants, it interferes with target cell chemistry at multiple sites. The $9 9 . 5 \\%$ technical liquid caused corrosion in the Draize assay. There were no dermal sensitization studies available for review. Corrosion associated with liquid chloropicrin was reported during World War I when it was used as a chemical weapon (Underhill 1919).\n\n1,3-Dichloropropene (1,3-D, or trade name Telone) is a mixture of 1,3-dichloropropene cisand trans-isomers. A contaminant, 1;1,2- dichloropropane, may also be present in small quantities $( < 0 . 1 \\% )$ . It is used as a nematicide, fungicide, insecticide, and herbicide on food, feed, fiber, and on nursery crops. As a restricted use pesticide, 1,3-D can only be applied by certified applicators. In 2009, 1,3-D ranked fifth for pesticide use in California, based on use by weight. 1,3-D is a cutaneous irritant and may occasionally provoke ACD.",

Ticks and mites are also susceptible to sulfur. Elemental sulfur exists in various crystalline forms, with rings containing 6, 8, 10, or 12 sulfur atoms, or repeating concatenated chains (Cotton and Wilkinson 1972). Insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents, wettable sulfur is prepared by adding wetting and dispersing agents to finely ground sulfur. Micronized wettable sulfur is made by means of a special manufacturing process to ensure an extremely fine particle size.\n\nBy pound, sulfur continues to be the most applied pesticide in the state of California (DPR 2015a). Many of the sulfur products registered are for fruits and vegetables. Grapes and peanuts are examples of crops commonly treated with sulfur. Sulfur also has uses for vertebrate control and for treatment of conditions in domesticated animals such as dogs and horses. Cases of dermatitis in applicators demonstrate its capacity for causing skin irritation, especially in hot weather when transformation to irritant oxides of sulfur may occur more readily. Cases of ACD have also been reported.\n\nCopper products are extensively used in various agricultural and industrial settings as fungicide, algaecide, and wood preservatives. Copper compounds formulated as dusts and as powders are irritating to the skin, respiratory tract, and the eyes. Particularly, copper hydroxide, basic copper sulfate, and copper sulfate pentahydrate have been reported to have severe skin and eye irritation potential (Hostynek and Maibach 2004).",

    "content": "# 6.2 Phthalimide Compounds\n\nWith a common structure of a six-sided (cyclohexene, partially unsaturated cyclohexane, or benzene) ring joined to a heterocyclic fivesided (indole) ring, the phthalimido compounds can act as reactive electrophiles. This chemical property correlates with contact sensitization and carcinogenicity in animal studies. According to studies of captan given orally to animals, phthalimide breaks down to the irritant thiophosgene and to metabolites with partially intact dicarboximide compounds such as tetrahydrophthalimide (THPI), thiazolidine-2-thione4-carboxylic acid (TTCA), or phthalic acid. Measurement of metabolites can be used to estimate exposure when the relationship of absorbed dose and individual metabolites has been established (Galea et al. 2011, 2015; Berthet et al. 2012). For purposes of predicting the skin effects of captan and the other phthalimido compounds, the potential formation of irritant thiophosgene by dermal metabolism appears the most significant. Captan is still used in the USA. Based on the published literature, plandrel, captafol, and folpet have chiefly been used in Europe.\n\nCaptan is a widely used fungicide on a variety of food and feed crops and ornamental plants. It is also used as a seed protectant and in adhesives and paints as an antimicrobial. Agricultural workers may be exposed during and after spraying operations. Studies on pesticide ACD in India and Taiwan identified captan as a common sensitizer in farmers. Marzulli and Maibach (1974) demonstrated that a captan concentration of $1 \\%$ is a significant contact allergic sensitizer. Captan was reported to be a frequent sensitizer in Danish greenhouse and garden workers (Paulsen 1998). The ICDRG and NACDG later found captan in a $1 \\%$ concentration to be an irritant on patch testing; $0 . 2 5 \\%$ in petrolatum is now preferred for patch testing. Positive photo-patch test reaction to $0 . 1 \\%$ captan in petrolatum has also been reported (Mark et al. 1999).\n\nCaptafol (Difolatan) is a broad-spectrum protective contact fungicide that is no longer sold in the USA. It is effective for the control of almost all fungal diseases of plants except powdery mildews and is still used outside the USA. It is reported as a moderate irritant and sensitizer on an Extoxnet toxicology summary (EXTOXNET 1998). Public domain literature includes multiple reports regarding captafol-associated ACD.",

Related potassium and sodium thiocarbamate salts are used as fumigants. The compounds interact broadly with fungal enzyme systems. Potential systemic adverse reactions include antithyroid activity produced by the thiocarbamate metabolite ethylenethiourea (ETU), antithyroid activity similar to propylthiouracil (PTU), and inhibition of alcohol metabolism similar to disulfiram (Antabuse). ETU produces thyroid adenomas in rodent cancer studies and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) terms the evidence as sufficient to classify it as an animal carcinogen, although the evidence from human cancer studies is inconclusive (classified as inadequate by IARC).\n\nThiocarbamates and ETU have wide use in the production of rubber products. Bruze and Fregert (1983) initially identified ETU as a contact sensitizer in a 53-year-old woman with dermatitis of the fingers, who had worked for 15 years handling natural and synthetic rubber. Twenty controls did not react to $1 \\%$ aqueous ETU. She reacted to a sample of black rubber and to ETU in aqueous concentrations between $0 . 0 1 \\%$ and $1 \\%$ , but not to $0 . 0 0 1 \\%$ ETU. Many of the thiocarbamate fungicides also cause sensitization, possibly because of metabolism that generates ETU in the skin.\n\nThiophanate-methyl (TM) is a systemic fungicide with a broad spectrum of activity for plant disease. TM is used on a variety of trees, vine, and other crops, as well as lawns and ornamentals. There are no registered food uses in the USA.

Positive patch testing to PCNB, $1 \\%$ in petrolatum, has been described for a worker packing pesticide powders who developed dermatitis (Cronin 1980). Positive PCNB patch test reactions occurred in nursery workers with exposure from routine handling and residue contact (O’Malley et al. 1995). Most workers did not recall individual materials handled and work records were not available. It was not possible to determine if the PCNB reactions arose from prior exposure or from de novo sensitization.",

Modes of action include by interfering with electron transport in photosynthesis, disruption of microtubule function, inhibition of lipid synthesis and amino acid synthesis, and mimicry of plant hormone (auxin) function. Most have low systemic toxicity, but the very reactive bipyridyl compounds interfere with many mammalian cell functions and may prove fatal with sufficient exposure. The most numerous agricultural applications of herbicides occur in row-crop farming, but nonagricultural applications of lawns, parks, golf courses, and other areas are also common.

    "content": "# 7.1 Bipyridyl Compounds\n\nParaquat and diquat are bipyridyl compounds that have reactive ammonium ions in their core structures. Superoxides generated by the bipyridyl compounds damage plant cell membranes and cytoplasm and are especially active during photosynthesis. The compounds are absorbed by foliage and translocated into the plant vascular system. Both paraquat and diquat are contact herbicides and desiccants, used on cotton, potatoes, and soybeans, alfalfa, clover, and soybeans. They have no biological activity once absorbed onto clay soils or organic matter (Penagos et al. 2000). However, some degradation on leaf surfaces results from photodecomposition (Tomlin 1997). The acute toxicity of paraquat (rat oral $\\begin{array} { l l l } { { \\mathrm { L D 5 0 } } } & { { = } } & { { 1 2 6 ~ \\mathrm { \\ m g / k g } \\nonumber } } \\end{array}$ far exceeds that of glyphosate.\n\nParaquat-related ICDs have been reported. Because of limited dermal absorption, skin contact with paraquat does not usually result in systemic poisoning, with exceptions as reported in public domain literature (Zhou et al. 2013; Wesseling et al. 1997; Garnier et al. 1994; Smith 1988; Newhouse et al. 1978). Prolonged skin contact and prior damage to skin appear as predisposing factors in many fatal cases.\n\nWorkers in factories where paraquat is manufactured have an increased risk of occupationally induced keratoses, Bowen’s disease, and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (Bowra et al. 1982; Wang et al. 1987). The manufacturing process stream, potentially contaminated with tarry polynuclear aromatics, may have caused these premalignant and malignant skin lesions, rather than the paraquat itself.\n\nDiquat (or diquat dibromide), like paraquat, owes its herbicidal action to its effect on cell membranes and enzyme systems. This nonselective mechanism accounts for its mammalian toxicity. Clark and Hurst (1970) reported a rat oral LD50 for diquat equal to $2 3 1 \\mathrm { m g / k g }$ . Doses higher than the LD50 produced CNS symptoms; chronic low-dose administration in both dogs and rats produced both produced cataracts.\n\nAmitrole (Aminotriazole) is a systemic herbicide used to control nonselective grasses, broadleaf weeds, cattails, poison ivy, and certain aquatic weeds. It is registered for nonfood uses, primarily industrial and nonagricultural uses, soils, and ornamental crops. One case of ACD to aminotriazole has been reported in a contract weed control operator (English et al. 1986).\n\nPyrazon [5-amino-4-chloro-2-phenyl-3(2H)- pyridazinone], also known as chloridazon, is a herbicide belonging to the pyridazinone class of pesticides. It inhibits photosynthesis by blocking electron transport. Pyrazon is registered for use on sugar beets and red table beets to control certain weeds. This compound is also registered for commercial use on ornamentals, including bulb crops and roses. Pyrazon can persist in the soil for several months.\n\nPyrazon causes minimal irritation in the Draize assay and is negative in predictive animal sensitization studies. A formulation registered in Canada carries a sensitization warning, possibly related to an isothiazolin compound that was included as a preservative. ACD to pyrazon spray has been reported in a farmer who developed dermatitis every spring when spraying pyrazon (chloridazon) or thinning treated plants (Bruze and Fregert 1982). Patch testing with a $1 \\%$ concentration of the AI and the formulated product $43 \\%$ AI) caused a vesicular, bullous reaction. Additional testing showed a positive response to $0 . 0 1 \\%$ but not to $0 . 0 0 1 \\%$ AI.\n\nPhenmedipham (Betanal) belongs to the phenylcarbamate family and functions by inhibiting electron transport during plant photosynthesis. It controls early-stage broadleaf weeds for beets and spinach. Severe allergic dermatitis associated with phenmedipham (Betanal) was confirmed by patch testing in two farmers (Nater and Grosfeld 1979). Cases of dermatitis accompanied by systemic hypersensitivity have also been reported.\n\nDichlobenil (2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile) inhibits shoot formation from roots, acting principally as a pre-emergent herbicide. Draize tests on multiple formulations showed only minimal irritation. The technical formulation did not produce sensitization in a guinea pig study, but a $1 5 \\%$ aqueous concentrate was positive in an assay using an intradermal induction phase. Development of facial comedones in men engaged in mixing or bagging dichlobenil was also reported. The lag times varied from 1 week to 5 months after beginning work, and none of the men had history of facial acne.\n\nTriazines (atrazine, propazine, and simazine) are chlorinated triazine herbicides, systemic herbicides usually applied to the soil. Once absorbed through leaves and roots, these herbicides act by inhibiting photosynthesis within the targeted plant. They are widely used as selective to control most annual grasses and broadleaf weeds before the weeds emerge or after the removal of weed growth. The triazine herbicides have common chlorinated breakdown products and common mechanisms of toxicity.\n\nThe triazines cause minimal irritation in the Draize test and do not cause sensitization in predictive allergy testing. California surveillance data does include occasional cases of irritation in pesticide handlers associated with direct accidental exposures. The public domain literature does not clearly document cases of ACD associated with triazines.\n\nAcetanilides (chloroacetamide) herbicides include alachlor, butachlor, metolachlor, and propachlor. These herbicides inhibit cell elongation and cell division, limiting the emergence of developing leaves and roots. They act by electrophilic inhibition of elongase, the enzyme initiating the elongation of very-long-chain fatty acids.\n\nDraize tests show moderate irritation for concentrated formulations of allidochlor and butachlor. Predictive sensitization assays are positive for acetochlor, alachlor, and butachlor. ACD confirmed by patch testing has been reported in public domain literature. A case of IgE-mediated allergic hepatitis associated with dermal exposure to butachlor in a worker from India was reported (Daryani et al. 2007). Butachlor is a rice herbicide, not currently registered in the USA or the EU, but widely used in Asia.\n\n2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid $( 2 , 4 \\ – D )$ is a herbicide in the phenoxy or phenoxyacetic acid family. Like 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) and sterically similar products, it functions as a synthetic plant hormone or auxin that disrupts normal growth of broadleaf weeds. Cases of ACD in farmers have been reported. Severe contact dermatitis associated with a mixture of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T has been noted.",

    "content": "# 8 Insecticides\n\nThe new structural categories of insecticides shown in Table 3 were associated with few reported cases of dermatitis. The following section concentrates on plant-derived compounds (pyrethrum, pyrethrin, and their synthetic derivatives; nicotine and rotenone), the cholinesterase inhibitors, currently registered organochlorines, organotin compounds, and biologicals.\n\nPyrethrum from the dried flowers of Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium is the most widely used botanical insecticide in the USA. Refined pyrethrum or pyrethrin esters are the AIs extracted from pyrethrum. The flowers and extracts for pyrethrum are imported from Kenya and Ecuador into the USA. Although pyrethrins are powerful, fast-acting contact-insecticides that are effective at very low concentrations, they have a low order of systemic toxicity to most mammals.\n\nThe active principals are pyrethrins I and II, cinerins I and II, and jasmolin I and II, collectively known as pyrethrins. Pyrethrins are used extensively in stock sprays, pet sprays, household sprays, aerosols, and food protection in warehouses. Considered nonsynthetic, pyrethrins have been allowed in organic crop production. Pyrethrins are stable for long periods in waterbased aerosols, in which modern emulsifiers are used. To increase effectiveness, pyrethrins may be mixed with a synergist such as piperonyl butoxide (PBO). PBO is a synthetic compound that inhibits metabolic degradation of the AI.\n\nDermatitis from natural pyrethrins is usually reported to occur on exposed body parts. Mitchell et al. (1972) identified the sesquiterpene lactone pyrethrosin as the chief allergen in unrefined pyrethrin. Asthma and urticaria have also been reported as reactions to natural pyrethrin (Franzosa et al. 2007). However, the authors contend that refined pyrethrum currently used lacks the presence of proteins and other allergens likely to cause type I hypersensitivity. The report also provides an interesting summary of possible cases of type I reaction to unrefined or minimally refined pyrethrins dating back to 1897.\n\nCaution should be used when interpreting results of allergy tests performed with current pyrethrum allergen extracts; Osimitz et al. (2009) found no detectable pyrethrins and pyrethrosin in six commercially available pyrethrum allergen extracts analyzed. Aside from the absence of pyrethrins and pyrethrosins, unknown components, such as high-molecular-weight proteins or other impurities that may cause dermal reactions, could be present in significant amounts. Moreover, recent reports of pyrethrum-producing ACD in humans and speculations of crossreactions occurring in ragweed-sensitized people should also be interpreted critically.\n\nPyrethroids are synthetic compounds produced to duplicate the biological activity of the active principals of pyrethrum. Pyrethroids have a longer duration of activity against insects than pyrethrum and have greater biological potency. In acute oral toxicity studies, they typically have much lower LD50 than pyrethrin. They are not teratogenic, mutagenic, or carcinogenic in animal studies.\n\nThere are two main classes of these synthetic insecticides. Type I pyrethroids do not have an alpha-cyano group (allethrin, alphamethrin, barthrin, biopermethrin, bioresmethrin, cismethrin, cyclethrin, indothrin, permethrin, phthalthrin, and resmethrin), while type II pyrethroids have an alpha-cyano group attached to the 3-phenoxybenzyl alcohol of the molecule (deltamethrin, cypermethrin, fenvalerate, and fenpropathrin). Like with pyrethrins, the activity of pyrethroids may be enhanced by the addition of a synergist such as PBO.\n\nThe primary route of occupational exposure for pyrethroids is skin contact. Systemic toxicity from occupational contact with these agents is minimal. The most prominent health symptom that accompanies topical contact with these agents appears to be paresthesia caused by pyrethroid stimulation of cutaneous nerve endings. The symptom resembles paresthesias produced by stimulant drugs, but occurs at the site of contact. Inhalation may produce stimulation of superficial nerves in the upper respiratory passages, increased nasal secretions, and other rhinitis symptoms, sometimes accompanied by transient systemic symptoms (Spencer and O’Malley 2006).\n\nTemporary paresthesias manifested by numbness, itching, burning, tingling, and warmth have been reported following cutaneous exposure to the synthetic pyrethroid fenvalerate. Fenvalerate, produced in the USA, produces more paresthesias following topical exposure than pyrethrin and other pyrethroids. Topical vitamin E acetate appears to be highly effective in treating paresthesias induced by pyrethroids (Tucker et al. 1984) if applied in a timely way after exposure.\n\nNicotine is extracted from tobacco plants (Nicotiana species) and is one of the oldest botanical insecticides in use today. Having largely been replaced by organophosphate insecticides, only one product is currently registered for use with the U.S. EPA. Nicotine may be readily absorbed through the skin and is toxic to mammals (Saleeon et al. 2015; Gehlbach et al. 1974; McBride et al. 1998).\n\nTransdermally absorbed nicotine-induced predominantly sudorific and rubiform reactions, which may be accompanied by subtle piloerection, hyperalgesia, and pruritus. Exposed workers may develop nausea, vomiting, dizziness, prostration, and weakness. Abrasions on the skin during the harvesting of tobacco leaves increase the percutaneous absorption of nicotine. No positive patch test reactions have been reported, even among cigar makers with dermatitis (Bonamonte et al. 2016).\n\nRotenone is a selective contact insecticide and repellent. Current registered products primarily target vertebrate animals, specifically fish. The cube plant is now the only commercial source in the USA of rotenone for insecticide production, although derris, timbo, and other related rotenonecontaining plants have been utilized. The plant root may be ground as a dust or extracted to provide concentrate.\n\nRotenone has, in the past, been used as dust for garden insects, lice, and ticks on vertebrate animals. Rotenone has also been used in combination with pyrethrin and PBO (a synergist) to control a wide variety of insects on food crops.\n\nRotenone results in relatively low acute toxicity with dermal exposure and has not been reported to be a sensitizer. Skin irritation from rotenone has been reported among workers in rotenone processing plants in South America. Skin inflammation was most notable in intertriginous areas or where the powder had been trapped by perspiration on the skin. A similar outbreak was reported among workers in France, but improved ventilation and dust masks diminished the occurrence of dermatitis in these workers (Hayes 1982).\n\nOdor from an application of rotenone to a Northern California lake was associated with symptoms in residents of a nearby community. The odor was probably related to a naphthalenerange aromatic solvent present in the formulation rather than the AI (Verder-Carlos and O’Malley 2002).\n\nSpinosad is an organic insecticide made up of spinosyn A and spinosyn D, derived from soil microbes (actinomycete organism Saccharopolyspora spinosa). Spinosad compounds selectively inhibit nicotine receptors in insects (Kirst 2010).",

Sodium arsenite has been used as a sterilant herbicide and a potato vine killer. Sodium arsenate was formerly the toxicant in many ant syrups for household use, but this application has been discontinued. For the most part, inorganic arsenicals have been superseded because of their hazard to humans and animals.\n\nA handful of products remain registered as a fungicide and insecticide for use as wood protection treatments (arsenic acid and arsenic pentoxide). Arsenic trioxide is also currently available as an ant bait and insecticide. Organic arsenicals such as monosodium methanearsonate (MSMA), disodium methanearsonate (DSMA), calcium acid methanearsonate (CAMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (cacodylic acid) were herbicides used primarily on cotton and turf and lawns. However, uses of organic arsenic herbicides were discontinued due to concerns that applied organic arsenicals could potentially transform into more toxic inorganic forms, which may contaminate drinking water. Inorganic arsenic is both a cutaneous irritant and sensitizer. Hyperkeratosis, hyperhidrosis, and hypermelanosis are considered evidence of chronic systemic exposure. The hyperpigmentation is most marked on surfaces exposed to light and does not extend to mucous membranes. There may be a speckled depigmentation of pigmented areas giving a “raindrop” appearance. Arsenic compounds similar to or identical to those used as pesticides have been shown to be carcinogenic in man (Hayes 1982). Agricultural workers are also exposed to chronic ultraviolet (UV) light. It had been believed that UV light exposure was a more significant factor for these workers than their exposure to inorganic arsenic.\n\nFenbutatin-oxide provides an alternative to propargite for the control of mites. Other organotin compounds are used primarily as antimicrobials in industrial settings. No public domain reports on skin effects of fenbutatinoxide were found. The 31 studies retrieved focused on analytical and product chemistry, and pest resistance.\n\nPropargite is an organosulfite that controls mites by inhibition of a mitochondrial enzyme, ATP synthase. It causes direct skin irritation, both in pesticide handlers (mixers, loaders, applicators, field flaggers for aerial applications, and workers who repair contaminated spray equipment) and field workers in contact with residue. The long environmental half-life has necessitated long postapplication re-entry intervals.\n\nA noteworthy $30 \\%$ extended-release preparation has not been registered since the 1990s; it was associated with an outbreak of dermatitis among orange harvesters published in 1986. The environmental dissipation rate for this formulation did not differ substantially from the rate for the $32 \\%$ wettable powder (WP), studied during a subsequent outbreak in 1988. However, the initial residue deposition was markedly elevated compared to the WP formulation.",

These chemicals have had insecticide and/or larvicide uses as spray oils on agricultural crops and by residential homeowners, as well as occupational and residential uses as acaricides, fungicides, and herbicides, in addition to aquatic uses as mosquito larvicides/pupacides. These chemicals are also commonly used as inert ingredients in formulations of pesticides with other AIs. Petroleum oil, mineral oil, petroleum distillates, and kerosene each ranked in the top 100 pesticides used in California in 2015, based on pounds applied statewide (DPR 2015a).\n\nKerosene, first used in 1877, may have been the first petroleum oil to be used for insect control. Presently, it is widely used as a solvent or carrier for household and industrial pesticide sprays. Registered in the state of California as an adjuvant (broadly defined as any nonpesticide material added to a pesticide product or pesticide spray mixture to enhance the pesticide’s performance), kerosene is considered to be an “inert” ingredient by the U.S. EPA. Kerosene may be sulfonated to provide an odorless oil, or deodorants may also be added.\n\nKerosene and other petroleum distillates are known cutaneous irritants.

Use of OPs in California has continuously declined since 1995 (DPR 2004, 2010, 2015b).\n\nMalathion is a broad-spectrum organophosphate (OP) insecticide, with moderate to low systemic toxicity. Its uses include control of a wide variety of insects: in various food and feed crops, pastures and rangeland, outdoor garden insects around the home, and for pest eradication programs. The small number of current registrations, in contrast to the larger number of inactive registrations, reflects changing patterns of use.\n\nNaled is an insecticide and acaricide used on food and feed crops and on nonfood crops (such as ornamentals, and alfalfa grown for seed and cotton). Public health and residential uses for naled are primarily for the control of mosquitos. It is also used to control black flies and leaf-eating insects. Intermediate in toxicity between malathion and parathion, naled is broken down by hydrolysis within a few hours. In its native form, the reactive element in naled is the dibromodichloropropanol moiety, hypothetically formed as an intact molecule on breakdown. Dichlorvos (DDVP) forms as an environmental transformation product of naled. Surface residues after naled application on grapes, for example, contain about $30 \\%$ dichlorvos $6 \\ : \\mathrm { h r }$ . after application (Penagos et al. 2000).\n\nDichlorvos (2, 2-dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate), also known as DDVP, has been formulated as sprays, wettable powder, aerosols, resin strips, flea collars, and as a veterinary anthelmintic. It is closely related to two other OP insecticides, naled and trichlorfon. Both compounds metabolize or degrade to DDVP in food, water, or the environment. Accidental contact can cause irritation to the skin, possibly complicated by systemic cholinesterase inhibition.",

    "content": "# 8.4 Carbamates\n\nThe transient cholinesterase inhibition from carbamates often proves difficult to detect, but cholinesterase should be evaluated where possible in relevant cases of dermatitis. The following section focuses on currently registered compounds of moderate toxicity.\n\nCarbaryl (trade name Sevin), a carbamate, is a widely used broad-spectrum insecticide for agricultural crops, professional turf management, home gardens, and control of ectoparasites on pets. Technical carbaryl and granular formulations cause only short-term irritation in predictive animal tests, and a concentrated dry flowable product did not cause sensitization in predictive allergy tests. Cases reported to the California illness registry indicate that carbaryl formulations can cause short-term irritant symptoms following direct accidental exposure. The registry shows similar cases for two other carbamates: methomyl and propoxur. Patch test series with positive tests for carbaryl include Penagos (2004) and Sharma and Kaur (1990).\n\nMethiocarb (Mesurol) is a carbamate insecticide, acaricide, molluscicide, and avian repellant. ACD due to methiocarb has been reported.",

DEET, considered the best all-purpose insect and acaricide, is especially effective against mosquitoes. Poorly soluble in water, it is soluble in ethanol and propylene glycol and remains effective for several hours postapplication. DEET has repeatedly been associated with contact urticaria.

As revealed by the extensive list of pesticide active ingredients, the agricultural industry relies heavily on these chemical, biological, and physical agents to combat pests. The intricate classification of pesticides into various categories and chemical structures aids in comprehending their potential dermatological effects. While certain compounds have been consistently associated with skin manifestations, vigilance is required as novel pesticide groups emerge, often with unfamiliar chemical structures and modes of action. With the ongoing evolution of pesticide usage and registration, continued research and clinical awareness are paramount to effectively manage and prevent pesticide-related dermatoses in agricultural settings.",

In agricultural farming, pesticides are used to efficiently manage pests and diseases, resulting in higher food production, reduced food waste, and increased farmer profit. Unfortunately, over $90 \\%$ of pesticides drain into the environment and persist in agricultural products, causing environmental pollution, which are major drawbacks of a chemical-based traditional pesticide formulation. In the past few years, nanoemulsion-based pesticides have been developed to be effective, nontoxic, cost-effective, and possess excellent physico-chemical stability and greater biodegradability. For this purpose, there is a great interest in the design of efficient nanoemulsion-based pesticide formulations. Two normally immiscible liquids (water and oil) are combined in these formulations to produce an isotropic system. This chapter discusses various scientific concerns and approaches, including preparation method, composition, characterization, and biological properties pertaining to developing nanoemulsion-based pesticide formulations.\n\nKeywords Nanoemulsion $\\cdot$ Formulation $\\cdot$ Pesticide $\\cdot$ Eco-friendly · Biodegradability",

    "content": "# 1 Introduction\n\nIn the upcoming years, ensuring food security and feeding the growing world population will be a major challenge. Pesticides are essential for preventing crop losses and assuring food security [95, 149]. In the upcoming decades, pesticide use will be progressively crucial for resolving food security challenges related to ensuring a sufficient food supply for the expanding global population [32, 133]. Pesticide usage has risen significantly during the previous few decades. An estimated 5.2 billion pounds of pesticides are used annually worldwide [89]. The United Nations Population Division predicts the world population will rise by about $30 \\%$ by 2050. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) claims that $80 \\%$ of the food required to maintain this development must rise from increased production of present crops [134]. In agriculture, synthetic pesticides, including organochlorides, organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, and neonicotinoids, have been widely used since the 1950s due to their effectiveness and rapidity action, cheapness, and convenience of usage. Around 2.5 million tonnes of pesticides are expected to be employed on crops annually [39]. Current excessive usage of traditional synthetic pesticides poses several threats to human health and the environment [1]. There is a rising interest in developing innovative and effective pesticides with less detrimental ecological impacts than synthetic pesticides [116].\n\nPesticides are grouped into insecticides, fungicides, nematicides, herbicides, and plant growth regulators based on the types of living organisms they kill. They can be used in sustainable agriculture [121], forestry [113], and non-agricultural purposes [101]. It is well known that the majority of pesticide-active constituents are typically hydrophobic compounds that must be combined with a solvent, an emulsifier, and a dispersant in order to produce an appropriate water-based formulation, such as emulsifiable concentrates (ECs) and wettable powders (WPs), for fumigation [120, 152]. Pesticides are rarely utilized directly in their purified chemical form commercially. Therefore, commercial pesticide formulations can be categorized as solid (granules or powders), liquid (solutions or suspensions), and gaseous (vapors). In addition to solutions and emulsifiable concentrates, microemulsions, oil-in-water emulsions, and soluble concentrates are also considered liquid forms [137].\n\nA nanoemulsion is a mixture of two or more liquids that cannot mix, in which tiny droplets of one liquid are dispersed throughout another liquid [57]. Most nanoemulsions have a milky, opaque, or transparent appearance due to the size of the droplets, which can be between $1 0 { - } 3 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ . Nanoemulsion is sometimes called a miniemulsion, sub-micron emulsion, or ultrafine emulsion due to its size range of $^ { 2 0 - }$ $5 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ [123]. A nanoemulsion has thermodynamic instability but dynamic stability. The formulation of a nanoemulsion involves both high-energy and low-energy processes. Hence, it uses the underlying physico-chemical attributes of the system’s components and is sensitive to the arrangement in which chemicals are blended throughout the formulation [12]. The three primary components of nanoemulsions are oil, water, and surfactant. The system is formed subsequently when the surfactant layer separates the oil and aqueous phase. In a nanoemulsion system, the interfacial tension exerted by surfactants separates two immiscible phases,oil and water phase [33]. Conventional pesticide formulations are typically employed inefficiently due to loss and poor leaf adherence, resulting in significant resource waste and environmental pollution. Nanoemulsions possess tiny droplets, homogeneous distribution, high stability, convenient synthesis, and superior deposition, expansion, and penetration of the pest body and plant foliage surface [126, 152]. Therefore, developing more effective formulation methods for pesticides is being promoted globally [9]. In order to develop efficient nanoemulsion-based pesticides, the appropriate formulation technologies must be developed.\n\n\n# 2 Components of Nanoemulsion\n\nThe outlines of nanoemulsion components are depicted in Fig. 1.",

    "content": "# 2.1 Oil Phase\n\nOne of the essential parts of making a nanoemulsion is selecting the appropriate oil for the oily phase. This is because the oil affects how easily the active component dissolves and how easy it is to make a nanoemulsion for a specific purpose. If the pesticide is liquid at room temperature, it may be the only factor in the oil phase. Other suitable environmental solvents such as corn, coconut, olive, peanut, soybean, castor, corn, and sunflower oils could also be used. It may also be essential to combine a liquid pesticide that dissolves in water well with a solvent that does not dissolve in water. This is called a “ripening inhibitor,” It slows the growth of droplets caused by Ostwald ripening, which is the movement of pesticide molecules from small droplets to large droplets when the Laplace pressure is different [22]. Pesticide particles can be suspended in an oil phase, but most suspension concentrates are usually dispersed in water [100]. The low solubility of oil in the solution improves nanoemulsion longevity by acting as a kinetic shield to Ostwald ripening. Ostwald ripening is the net movement of oil from tiny droplets to bigger droplets by continuous phase transport [141]. Because oil has many biological properties, dissolving it in a nanoemulsion could increase its cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and antimicrobial properties against pathogenic microbes. The biological responses of essential oils to infections will be affected by the varying phytochemical compositions of oils [21, 48].\n\nFig. 1 Components of nanoemulsion",

The classification of surfactants is based on: a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail. In preparing W/O nanoemulsion, surfactants with hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) values between 3 and 6 are desirable, but for the production of O/W nanoemulsion, surfactants with HLB values between 8 and 18 are favourable. Surfactants with an HLB value greater than 20 serve as cosurfactants for reducing surfactant concentrations to an appropriate level and forming microemulsions. The examples of various oils, surfactants, and co-surfactants are listed in Table 1.\n\nThree different types of nanoemulsions can be produced, and they are as follows: water in oil (W/O), oil in water (O/W), and bi-continuous [23] (Fig. 2).\n\n\n1.

Microemulsions generally develop via thermodynamic self-assembly; however, nanoemulsions require external shear to separate the droplets. Microemulsions have numerous benefits, including thermodynamic stability, the convenience of preparation, transparency, low viscosity, homogeneity, and high solubility [19, 28]. Microemulsion formulations may provide a variety of benefits for pesticide encapsulation and application: (i) Preparation is simple because no specialist equipment is required (ii) Low environmental pollution (iii) Minimal production expenses because organic solvents are not used (iv) Using water as a solvent reduces the possibility of flammability and explosion and (v) Production of tiny oil droplets ( $1 0 { - } 1 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ in size) with increased permeability and absorption rate [25]. In comparison to nanoemulsion, microemulsion requires a more significant proportion of surfactant.\n\nPesticide microemulsion, a revolutionary water-based pesticide formulation, provides considerable development potential [49]. Microemulsions are defined by the tiny, homogenous droplets that make up the dispersed phase (less than $1 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ , [153]) which enhance the ability of pesticides to reach their target pests or plants [28]. Although the concentration of the active ingredient in microemulsions is low, the solubilization of the active ingredient and the presence of a large amount of surfactant may elevate the biological activity of the microemulsion. Considerable research on the development and stability of pesticide nanoemulsions have been published in recent years, with an emphasis on the high-energy emulsification method [85] and microemulsion dilution [135] as a method of production, in addition to methyl decanoate [135] and fatty acid methyl ester [84] as solvents.",

    "content": "# 4.1 Preparation Method of Nanoemulsions-Based Pesticides\n\nNanoemulsions are metastable systems, and how they are prepared influences the degree to which they are stable [135, 136]. Nanoemulsions lack thermodynamic stability but are kinetically stable. In addition, emulsions are understood to be nanoemulsions if the droplet sizes are measured in the nanometer range. The several nanoemulsion preparation processes include the following two methods: (1) lowenergy emulsification and (2) high-energy emulsification. The high-energy emulsification process consists of high-energy stirring, high-pressure homogenization, ultrasonic emulsification, membrane emulsification, and microfluidization.\n\nLow- and high-energy emulsification can be used to develop nanoemulsions. High-shear mixing, high-pressure homogenizers, high-energy emulsification techniques utilizing ultrasonic generators, and low-energy emulsification techniques utilizing the system’s stored energy are all well known. The hydrophobic insect repellent N, N-diethyl phenylacetamide (DEPA) was emulsified using the low-energy phase inversion temperature (PIT) method [16]. The technique is based on nonionic polyethoxylated emulsifiers’ capacity to alter their hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) values in response to temperature. The HLB decreases with increasing temperature. The ethoxylate unit’s dehydration is the cause of this decline. Therefore, changing the temperature while keeping the composition constant can change the relative affinity of the surfactant for the different phases [13]. The polyethoxylated surfactant hydrates at low temperatures, increasing its affinity for the watery medium.\n\nAs a consequence of this, it fosters the development of an O/W macroemulsion that is stable. Dehydration of the polyoxyethylene chain makes the surfactant more lipophilic, which reduces the stability of the O/W emulsion as the temperature rises. This is because of the emulsion’s interaction with the polymer. Surfactant stabilizes W/O emulsions at extremely high temperatures. The nonionic surfactant possesses exceptionally powerful affinities for both immiscible phases at either the PIT or the HLB temperature. The instability of both oil-in-water and water-in-oil macroemulsions in PIT results in a bi-continuous microemulsion structure or layered liquid crystal structure composed of oil, water, and surfactant [13]. As a result, nanoemulsions can be created, supporting the formation of only a few nanometers across emulsions. In order to make nanoemulsions that are kinetically stable through a transitional inversion, the emulsions must first be prepared in a region close to the PIT. Then they must be rapidly cooled or heated.\n\nA W/O emulsion can change into an O/W emulsion due to the rapid cooling after an emulsion is formed in the PIT zone. During a process known as reversed phase inversion, an O/W emulsion can be transformed into a W/O emulsion by rapidly raising the temperature. Fast temperature increases, or decreases of about $2 5 { - } 3 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ are required to create kinetically stable W/O or O/W nanoemulsions, respectively. If this is not done, the resulting emulsions will be lumpy and difficult to work with [8]. The emulsion inversion point (EIP) method is another low-energy technique for creating nanoemulsions [117]. In this instance, unlike the PIT method, a change in composition rather than a change in temperature initiates the phase reversal. Adding water to an oil-in-water emulsion creates a W/O emulsion, which is stabilized by a hydrophilic surfactant with a greater affinity for the water phase than the oil phase. This method’s primary goal is to produce a continuous oil phase. Emulsions stabilized with a surfactant with a higher affinity for the continuous phase are called “normal emulsions.” When water is first added to an emulsion, it only causes more water droplets to form in the oil-continuous phase of the emulsion. It is possible to permanently transform a W/O emulsion into an O/W emulsion by adding more water than is required to slow the rate at which the oil droplets coalesce [93]. This phase inversion process is called catastrophic phase inversion to differentiate it from the transitional phase reversal between two regular emulsions (CPI). The EIP procedure aims to produce pyrethrin-containing O/W nanoemulsions that are kinetically stable. They only detail the creation of micro- and nanoemulsions as encapsulation media using materials that are risk-free and naturally toxic [66]. When conducting an emulsification process, it is possible to reduce the amount of damage done to the environment by employing “green” nonionic surfactants and an oil phase derived from natural sources. The oil phase contained a wide range of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), including hexanoate, octanoate, decanoate, and laureate (methyl hexanoate/octanoate/decanoate/laurate $= 3 . 2 / 5 0 . 8 / 4 4 . 0 / 2 . 0 \\ \\mathrm { ( w / w ) ) }$ .\n\nNonionic surfactants such as 3-(3-hydroxypropyl)-heptamethyltrisiloxane (organosilicon), long-chain alkyl polyglycosides (LAPG), and short-chain alkyl polyglucosides (SAPG) are all eco-friendly options. Pseudo-ternary systems involving FAMEs, water, and surfactants containing $41 \\%$ (w/w) glyphosate isopropylamine salt were analyzed using phase diagrams to determine which systems had the potential to form microemulsions. These phase diagrams were applied in various ratios and for each surfactant. Microemulsion-based formulations were created using the study’s findings. Droplets smaller than $2 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ in size were achieved in O/W nanoemulsion glyphosate formulations by diluting the latter with much water (1:200) and mixing at a slow speed $2 0 0 \\mathrm { r p m }$ for $5 ~ \\mathrm { { m i n } }$ ). By contrasting the prepared glyphosate-loaded nanoemulsions with Roundup, a commercially available glyphosate formulation, their effectiveness in suppressing the narrow-leaf herb Eleusine indica was estimated. The optimal results were obtained with a nano vehicle consisting of $3 . 2 7 \\%$ FAMEs oil, $7 4 . 5 8 \\%$ water, and $2 2 . 1 5 \\%$ 8:2 LAPG: organosilicon surfactant matter. A phytotoxicity study was conducted on weed 7–8 days old. Herbicide was sprayed on the plants. Nine distinct glyphosate concentrations were used. The probit transformation was used to create sigmoidal dose–response curves, linearize them, and determine the effective doses (ED50) for the various treatments. Commercial product doses of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and $1 . 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { k g }$ herbicide/ ha were primarily used to determine average weed control rates corresponding to the nanoformulation. The ED50 for the nanoemulsion formulation was less than that of Roundup $\\mathrm { 0 . 4 8 \\ k g }$ herbicide/ha) at $0 . 4 0 \\mathrm { k g }$ . Nanoemulsion formulations also had lower surface tensions, allowing pesticides to penetrate leaves more efficiently and increased wettability compared to commercial products. Oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsions of neem oil-based nano pesticides stabilized with the hydrophilic surfactant Tween 20 were developed and characterized. In experiments, droplets as small as $3 1 . 0 3 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ were produced in nanoemulsions with an oil-to-surfactant ratio of 1:3.The LC50 was calculated to be $1 1 . 7 5 ~ \\mathrm { m g / L }$ at a droplet size of $3 1 . 0 3 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ , indicating a decreasing trend as droplet size was decreased [10].",

    "content": "# 4.2 Chemical Composition of Pesticide Nanoemulsions\n\nA review of the creation and formulation of pesticide delivery systems based on nanoemulsions is presented. Nanoemulsions of oil in water are examples of colloidal dispersions characterized by their thermodynamic instability. They typically consist of oil droplets emulsified and suspended in water. They are similar to oil-in-water emulsions in this respect, which are also common. Droplets larger than $2 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ are considered part of a conventional emulsion, while droplets smaller than $2 0 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ are considered part of a nanoemulsion [94]. Nanoemulsions have some benefits over traditional emulsions because of the tiny size of the droplets in them. These benefits include improved droplet stability, enhanced optical clarity, and an apparent rise in bioactivity. Droplet aggregation and gravitational separation are the other benefits [94]. Thermodynamic stability, not particle size characteristics, distinguishes nanoemulsions from microemulsions. Unlike their microemulsion counterparts, nanoemulsions are notoriously unstable from a thermodynamic standpoint. The kinetic stability of nanoemulsions, however, can be improved over time.\n\nIf the oil phase is liquid at room temperature, it might only contain pesticide. However, solid pesticides at room temperature or with high water solubility may need oil phase components added. A suitable solvent can be used to dissolve crystalline pesticides prior to homogenization. The ideal solvent should have a low water solubility, high pesticide solubility, wide availability, good safety characteristics, a reasonable price tag, and low toxicity, among other characteristics. It should also be environmentally friendly and widely accessible. Toluene and xylene are two examples of traditional aromatic solvents [85]. However, more eco-friendly options exist, such as methyl oleate [42]. Other examples of these solvents include methyl decanoate and methyl oleate. In theory, other environmentally friendly solvents like food-grade triglyceride oils could also be utilized. Inhibitors, which are insoluble in water, can be added to liquid pesticides to prevent droplet maturation and the spread of the pesticide molecules [22].\n\nOil-in-water emulsions are made using various kinds of natural and synthetic emulsifiers. All necessary conditions must be met, including low toxicity and environmental compatibility. These conditions include compatibility with pesticides, solvents, and other ingredients and stability against environmental conditions like temperature changes. Any emulsifier should be able to produce excellent emulsifying performance, which entails tiny oil droplets at low dosage levels. In pesticide nanoemulsions, the primary function of emulsifiers is to rapidly adsorb the oil produced during homogenization onto the droplet surfaces, lowering the interfacial tension and making it easier for further droplet fragmentation to take place [92]. Due to the small droplet size, nanoemulsions form an interfacial layer with a highly curved surface. Since the pressure inside the droplet is greater than the pressure outside, there is a pressure difference between the inner and outer sides of the interface. This differential pressure is called the Laplace pressure (P) [129]. Droplet stabilization is yet another function of emulsifiers in pesticide nanoemulsions. For an emulsifier to be effective during homogenization, it must first form a protective coating around the oil droplets [64]. Emulsifying molecules can accomplish this by creating a significant electrostatic or steric attraction between the oil droplets in the mixture.\n\nAdditionally, the colliding droplets can create an impermeable interfacial film that is challenging to separate. For this reason, the stability of nanoemulsions depends significantly on the mechanical strength of the interfacial film [83]. Typically, to prevent oil droplets from coalescing, emulsifier molecules should almost completely encapsulate the oil droplets. Nanoemulsion stability can be improved using small molecular alcohols or mixed emulsifiers to form a composite interfacial film [148].\n\nThe most widely used co-emulsifiers are alcohols with a hydrocarbon chain, a small polar head group, and a shorter carbon chain. Using a wide range of physicochemical mechanisms, these molecules can alter the interfacial layer’s optimal curvature, reduce interfacial tension, increase interfacial layer flexibility, and enhance emulsion formation and stability.\n\nUnderstanding the scientific principles governing nanoemulsion behavior as a function of composition is aided by a discussion of the various nanoemulsion components. For example, an aqueous phase and an oil phase form the basis of a typical nanoemulsion, which is then stabilized by an emulsifier or a surfactant. These phases are separated from one another by an emulsifier. The formation of the nanoemulsion, as well as its stability and the functional characteristics it possesses, are all influenced by the properties of the oleic component. These properties include density, viscosity, the value of the interfacial tension, and the refractive index. Typically, water acts as the polar phase of nanoemulsions, dictating their rheological behavior, interfacial tension, polarity, and ionic strength. The coalescence of oil droplets, flocculation, the gradual increase in average droplet size (Ostwald maturation), and gravity separation and sedimentation are the causes of the nanoemulsion’s breakdown into oil and water [77, 78]. As a result of electrostatic repulsion or steric hindrance, a surfactant that adsorbs oil droplets can prevent oil droplets from coalescing and colliding. By decreasing the IFT between the oil and water phases, oil droplets are stabilized against coalescence and collision [74, 75].\n\nCo-emulsifiers can also be used interchangeably with emulsifiers. Coemulsifiers are molecules of surfactant that can adhere to the surfaces of droplets; however, when used on their own, coemulsifiers cannot stabilize emulsions. In some cases, the formation of an emulsion or its stability can be enhanced by adding a co-emulsifier.",

    "content": "# 4.3 Optimization and Characterization of Nanoemulsion-Based Pesticides\n\nDynamic light scattering (DLS), small angle neutron scattering (SANS), viscosity, and atomic force microscopy are some of the analytical methods used to characterize nanoemulsions: nanoparticles, extreme transparency, tunable viscosity, robust stability, and other desirable traits (AFM). Using dynamic light scattering (DLS), the size of the droplets in a nanoemulsion can be determined. The physicochemical stability of the nanoemulsion is assessed by measuring the droplet size as a function of time with DLS. The reports state that the DLS method determines the Ostwald ripening rate [142]. The SANS technique is helpful for determining the nanoemulsions’ bulk structure because neutron wavelengths can investigate nanoscale structures [50]. The results from techniques like measuring the conductivity, dielectric properties, and nanoemulsion viscosity are appropriate at the macroscopic level. When the water content is raised, the nanoemulsion appears to have a lower viscosity. When the surfactant and co-surfactant content is reduced, it appears to have a higher viscosity. The viscosity variation aids in assessing the stability of nanoemulsion systems. Conductivity tests monitor the phase inversion phenomenon and establish whether the newly formed nanoemulsions are y/w or w/o in composition [27]. The dielectric properties are measured to assess nanoemulsions’ structural and dynamic properties. Atomic force microscopy can determine the nanoemulsion system’s droplet shape. Nanoemulsion systems are evaluated for their stability through battery stability tests, including centrifugation, freeze–thaw cycles, heating–cooling tests, and tests conducted at room temperature. The duration of stability that nanoemulsion systems can maintain without exhibiting Ostwald maturation, coalescence, creaming, or precipitation is examined in these tests. Consequently, the prepared system’s shelf life is predicted [29].\n\nPreformulation and parametric optimization are two crucial steps in creating agrochemicals based on nanoemulsions. To choose the optimization process’s starting point, these parameters are crucial. After they pass the initial screening, the samples are chosen for chemical and biological characterizations. Establishing the critical micelle concentration (CMC) or the surfactants’ hydrophobicity-limiting concentration (HLB) value is crucial in preformulation. The HLB value indicates the type of nanoemulsions produced, whether O/W, W/O, or some other type. When selfassembly begins, and the addition of surfactant no longer reduces the surface tension, the critical micelle concentration (CMC) value is reached. Fluorescent probe [26], surface plasmon resonance, dye solubility, tensiometry, viscosimetry, calorimetry, and electrical conductivity are just a few of the methods that have been used to determine the CMC value. According to previous studies, the pyrene fluorescent probe is one of the easiest and most accurate ways to determine CMC value. The peak difference method measures the absorbance of dissolved fleas in the systems. According to Lu et al. [88]’s graph of concentration versus absorbance, the CMC value is the intersection of the two line segments [45]. The choice of probe molecules impacts CMC measurement because of their charge and functional groups [62]. Several nanoemulsions with various parameters are created during the optimization process and put through the initial sieving process, which includes a centrifugation experiment, freeze–thaw cycle, heating cooling test, and $2 5 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ room temperature nanoemulsion stability test. The most stable nanoemulsion, which does not experience phase separation for a predetermined time, will be chosen for further characterization. In determining the thermodynamic stability studies, this step is crucial.\n\nCharacterizations such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), viscosity, zeta, pH measurement, morphology, biological properties, retention, and contact angle measurement are essential for nanoemulsion-based agrochemical formulations. The most popular method for figuring out the size and distribution of the nanoemulsion is DLS. To achieve maximum effectiveness, the nanoemulsion’s small size is preferred. There were a few factors thought to influence nanoemulsion size. Electrostatic interaction-induced aggregation can lead to unwanted multiple scattering effects, so samples are diluted with deionized water before analysis. The polydispersity index (PDI), which gauges system stability, is another area of interest during measurement. Picking a PDI value of less than 0.5 is considered to have good particle diameter uniformity, making it suitable for agricultural use. This is because this value indicates that the particles have a similar size. To characterize samples using DLS measurement, samples with higher PDI will be discarded due to their polydisperse properties [37, 34].\n\nMeasurement of viscosity, zeta, and pH; Using a Zetasizer apparatus, the electrophoretic characteristics of the nanoemulsion, also referred to as the zeta potential, are analyzed. The particle’s pH and the surrounding surface properties establish its zeta, a measure of the nanoemulsion’s stability. As the repulsive forces created by a negative zeta value are greater than the attractive forces between the droplets, coagulation, and coalescence are prevented in a dispersed emulsion. Because the attractive forces are weaker than the repulsive ones, this is the case. Increasing the amount of oil in a system may impact the nanoemulsion’s ability to maintain its stable structure [58]. Most pesticide nanoemulsions exhibit alkaline properties and have a $\\mathrm { p H }$ ranging from 5 to 6 [15]. The nanoemulsion’s viscosity was determined with an Ostwald viscometer. Several variables, such as the surfactants employed, the organic phase components, and the oil, can impact the measured viscosity. Since pesticide nanoemulsion is highly water-loaded and, therefore, of the O/W type, its viscosity is relatively low. However, the concentration of the surfactant can alter the nanoemulsion’s viscosity [7].\n\nNanoemulsion morphology and structure are studied using several types of microscopes like atomic force microscopes (AFMs), transmission electron microscopes (TEMs), and cryogenic field emission scanning electron microscopes (CryoFESEM). Clusters of nano micelles formed during preparation led to the formation of spherical [14] or core–shell-like structures [131] shapes for pesticide nanoemulsions have frequently been reported. When the sample is stored, the study is carried out by either monitoring the appearance of the sample or performing periodic measurements of its physicochemical properties. These measurements may include zeta potential or particle size. A stable system is one in which the sample does not undergo visual changes like phase separation, creaming, flocculation, fusion, or precipitation. Before and after storage, the nanoemulsion’s zeta potential and particle size are measured and compared [52].\n\nMeasurements of the attachment and contact angles of the leaves are taken to determine how much liquid pesticide should be applied to each leaf surface. The pesticide’s effectiveness can be improved by improving the nanoemulsion’s adherence to the leaves. Because the active ingredient has low interfacial tension, it allows for effective pesticide dilution on the plant surface. The fact that the nanoemulsion’s contact angle drops as its agrochemical content rises is evidence of this [119]. The effectiveness of pesticide nanoemulsions in combating pathogenic organisms can be investigated through biological studies. Researchers have focused on these plant-damaging organisms (bacteria, fungi, and insects) to eradicate or at least bring them under better control [118]. A nanoemulsion based on peppermint oil can be used as a pesticide because it reduces the biomass of the fungus Alternaria solani, which is responsible for the early blight that affects tomato plants [108]. The garlic oil nanoemulsion had a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of $0 . 2 3 \\%$ , which was lower than the value for pure garlic oil. This meant that it was more effective at destroying the proteins in Penicillin italicum.\n\nInsect morphological and histological damage following nanoemulsion treatment has been documented in other studies. They tested the nanoemulsions’ ability to irritate and seriously harm insect pests by penetrating their cuticle. According to SEM, tribolium castaneum exhibits necrosis and blackening due to Pimpinella anisum essential oil nanoemulsions [107]. Since they can significantly impact plant seedlings when used as a growth promoter or seed treatment, nanoemulsions are also regarded as growth promoters. It has been discovered that a nanoemulsion made of saponin and thymol essential oil can inhibit bacterial growth while fostering the growth of soybean plants [79]. The cottonseed plant’s germination process and resistance to fusarium wilt disease were improved by eugol oil nanoemulsion [2]. As a seed stimulant, methylcellulose nanoemulsion caused an 18 and $33 \\%$ increase in the length of the shoots and roots of maize seedlings [131]. Nanoemulsions of turmeric improved germination and growth when applied to watermelon seeds [6]. Pectin and neem oil nanoemulsion both show signs of stimulating growth in soybean seeds [125]. Many simulation studies that guide nanoemulsion EOR simulation studies using various simulation tools can be found throughout the emulsion EOR literature. Research and experiments conducted in the last few years are summarized in Table 2.",

    "content": "# 4.4 Accumulation, Dispersion, and Evaporation of Pesticide Nanoemulsions\n\nSurfactant molecules are concentrated at the interface between the pesticide and the water in a nanoemulsion of a pesticide. This results in the pesticide being dispersed in the water as nanoscale droplets. Depending on the amount and kind of surfactant used, nanoemulsions can be put into either kinetically stable or thermodynamically stable. Nanoemulsions with high thermodynamic stability can be made when the concentration of a strong repellent surfactant in the aqueous phase is greater than the critical micelle concentration, and a non-polar pesticide is at least partially soluble in water. These nanoemulsions can be used to combat a variety of pests (CMC). Under these conditions, micelles are globular clusters formed when the nonpolar parts of the surfactant molecules arrange themselves inward and coalesce with one another. The polar parts of the molecules extend outward into the aqueous solution. Micelles can be distinguished by their spherical shape. This aqueous solution’s free energy decreases when a non-polar pesticide is added, resulting in the molecules of the pesticide being directed to diffuse into the micelles. Micelles swell and create tiny droplets in this situation. The surfactant and pesticide content primarily influences these droplets’ size in each droplet and chemical composition [51]. This type of nanoemulsion is believed to be thermodynamically stable because the state of swollen micelles possesses the lowest amount of free energy. As a result, as long as the initial conditions are not altered, these nanoemulsions are stable indefinitely. This also means that emulsions form naturally when the surfactant, pesticide, and water components combine. Kinetic energy barriers or slow mass transport processes may require mechanical agitation or heating in practice [51]. These nanoemulsions are highly beneficial for pesticide formulations due to their high stability and straightforward preparation.\n\nTable 2 Recent research on nanoemulsions as an effective pesticide   \n\n<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Emulsifiers</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Dropletsize/typesof nanoemulsions</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Oil phase</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Processingmethod</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Function andapplications</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Keyreferecnes</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Tween 40</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>10-15 nmO/W</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>n-heptaneoil(a 7 carbonalkane</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ultrasonicationtechnique</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>UsedCMG-STARSTMto create acompositionalreservoir modelthat accuratelymatched theresults ofCMOST&#x27;slaboratoryflooding tests onthe surfactant/NPsnanoemulsions</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[77]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Tween 40</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>O/W</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>n-heptane oil</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>ultrasonicationtechnique</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>The increase innanoemulsionstability,improvement inwettabilitymodification, andthe wedgingaction wereattributed to animprovement inoil RF of 8.54%by nanoemulsion+ SiO2 NPs</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[74]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Tween 80</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&lt;40 nmO/W</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Toluene</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ultrasonicemulsification</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Reduced thepesticide load onthe environmentand humanpopulations byensuring thatdeltamethrin canstill effectivelyfight themosquitopopulation atlowerconcentrations</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[17]</td></tr></table>\n\nTable 2 (continued)   \n\n<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Emulsifiers</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Dropletsize/typesof nanoemulsions</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Oil phase</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Processingmethod</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Function andapplications</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Keyreferecnes</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Calcium alkylaromaticsulfonate,polyoxyethylenealiphatic1/42:3</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>31-300 nmO/W</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Solventnaphtha,xylene1/44:1</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Low-energyemulsification</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>With the contactangle beingsmaller and theadhesion beinghigher, the plantleaves would bemore easilyabsorbed into theliquid medicine,increasing themedicine&#x27;sefficacy</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[151]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Polyoxyethylene(40) castor oilether (EL-40)andpolyoxyethylene(20) castor oilether (EL-20)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>&lt;200 nmO/W</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Methyloleate</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Low-energyemulsification</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Thelow-emulsifyingprocess for highlystable pesticidenanoemulsionswas developed,and methyl oleatewas successfullyused as anenvironmentallyfriendlyalternativesolvent</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[42]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Polyoxyethyleneether</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>O/W</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cyclohexane</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>High energy(Ultrasonication)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>By carrying outparallel coreflood tests, thestudy sought todeterminewhethernanoemulsionscould be used toenhance flowback rate andliquid capabilityof gas injection</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[138]</td></tr></table>\n\nConsequently, there is currently a great deal of different commercial formulations available [132]. However, there are several drawbacks to this kind of nanoemulsion as well. For instance, they are expensive due to the sizeable amount of surfactant needed (typically $20 \\%$ by weight of the formulation), and only small amounts of pesticide are added to the micelles [81]. A high surfactant concentration can expose plants to unfavorable phytotoxicity, which is undesirable [67]. In addition, because of their propensity to form micelles, the only appropriate surfactant systems are those with a high level of repulsion. Formulation development is a time-consuming process because the ideal combination of surfactants and co-surfactants varies depending on the pesticide that needs to be emulsified. This causes the ideal combination to change from formulation to formulation [94].\n\nUnlike thermodynamically stable nanoemulsions, kinetically stable nanoemulsions form in environments where surfactant molecule aggregation into micelles is energetically unfavorable (such as with lower concentrations or weakly repellent surfactants). Kinetically stable nanoemulsions are almost entirely insoluble in pesticides. The water, pesticide, and surfactant combine to form a biphasic system at the outset, with the surfactant molecules preferentially accumulating at the pesticidewater interface. The system is subjected to shear (such as mixing), which blocks mixing due to interfacial repulsion. As a result, the pesticide phase becomes fragmented into droplets, and the surfactant coats each droplet. Larger pesticide droplets are stretched as this emulsion degrades further, becoming capillary unstable and fragmenting into smaller droplets. This procedure occurs until nanoscale pesticide droplets form [128]. Due to the nanoemulsion’s higher free energy than the stirred state, these nanoemulsions are thermodynamically unstable.\n\nConsequently, the Ostwald ripening process plays a significant part in separating the droplets from the aqueous phase. Surfactant on the droplet surfaces, however, creates an energy barrier that prevents mixing and slows down these processes. As a result of the fact that the pesticide droplets in the nanoemulsion in this scenario will continue to be dispersed for a sizeable amount of time, it has been determined that they are kinetically stable. This stability can last several years with considerable energy barriers (greater than $2 0 \\mathrm { k T } ,$ ), which is sufficient for most practical applications [53]. Due to eliminating the need for micelles, kinetically stable nanoemulsions can be formulated with significantly less surfactant $5 \\mathrm { - } 1 0 \\%$ by weight of the formulation) than thermodynamically stable nanoemulsions. This is because kinetically stable nanoemulsions do not form micelles. In addition, a broader selection of surfactant systems is available for use [94].\n\nMany processes, such as ultrasonication, high-pressure homogenization, phase transition, and phase inversion temperature, fall into high-energy mixing methods. The coarse emulsion is mixed using the ultrasonication method, which involves using high power and ultrasonic frequencies to stir a vibrating solid surface. Due to cavitations, which are caused when tiny liquid-free bubbles form and burst, the emulsion droplets are broken up by powerful shock waves and fast-moving liquid jets. Because the sound field that is emitted is typically not homogeneous, it is frequently necessary to recirculate the emulsion. This aims to give each droplet the maximum shear rate possible [91]. Even though this method is typically used in laboratories, it is challenging to scale it up to create pesticide nanoemulsions in commercially viable quantities [135, 136]. By utilizing a high-pressure positive displacement pump capable of operating at up to 2000 atmospheres, the emulsion of water, surfactant, and pesticide that has been previously prepared is pushed through rigid microchannels with a width of approximately $1 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ . The emulsion droplets produce very small droplets in the submicron range due to the excessive collisions, hydraulic shear, cavitations, and intense turbulence resulting from this. A homogeneous nanoemulsion is then produced by filtering the bulk emulsion to remove large droplets. It is recommended that the emulsion be prepared using high-volume pesticide fractions and then diluted to boost the emulsification process’s efficacy. Despite the possibility of coupling, more surfactant is added to stop it [87]. This technique is used in the lab and industry to create nanoemulsions [91]. Research in recent years has aimed to develop several low-energy emulsification techniques for dispersing non-polar liquids as nano-sized droplets to avoid the drawbacks associated with mixing with excessive shear. The primary goal of these strategies is to modify the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) or other conditions that affect the solubility of surfactants, such as temperature and composition. To that end, these methods employ various means to promote the formation of droplets on the nanoscale. Compared to high-energy methods, these tend to have lower costs,however, their development is significantly more difficult [11].\n\nUsing the temperature-dependent solubility of nonionic surfactants, phase inversion temperature is a low-energy method for reducing the size of pesticide droplets in an emulsion. The emulsion’s phase is altered (especially that of polyethoxylated surfactants) to achieve this. This procedure begins with creating a coarse O/W emulsion with a nonionic surfactant. This step is followed by Stage 2. Heating the emulsion increases the solubility of the nonionic surfactant in the pesticide phase and decreases solubility in the aqueous phase (reducing HLB). The pesticide droplets’ size is also diminished simultaneously (to create more surface area to accommodate the surfactant). At the phase inversion temperature, an O/W emulsion changes into a W/O emulsion, and the surfactant preferentially becomes soluble in the pesticide phase (also abbreviated as PIT). If the temperature rises, the water droplets’ size will continue to grow. The smallest droplet size is reached at temperatures just below the PIT. These minuscule droplets, though, are unstable and coalesce very quickly. Stabilizing the resulting nanoemulsion by rapidly cooling (to temperatures at least 20 degrees below PIT) increases fluid viscosity and decreases the rate at which pesticides diffuse through water. This slows the rate of aggregation and Ostwald ripening [61].\n\nFig. 3 Diagram of the production process for pesticide formulations based on nanoemulsions that have enhanced their physicochemical and biologic activities [102]\n\nThe phase transition method alters the environment to encourage the formation of pesticide droplets just below the temperature of PIT. A surfactant and pesticide are combined first. Then, water is added slowly to dilute the surfactant concentration and increase the ratio of pesticide to water, resulting in a practical solution [44].\n\nThe PIT for the emulsion shifts as a result of the gradual shift in composition that occurs while the temperature remains the same in this scenario.\n\nTo use the emulsification method (a water-soluble chemical and a pesticide), a mixture of pesticide, surfactant, and co-solvent must be prepared. After contact with water, an O/W nanoemulsion will automatically form independently. While intense fundamental research is still being done on the specific mechanisms these nanoemulsions produce, the “diffusion and envelopment” mechanism is currently the most widely accepted for self-emulsification [96]. There is mixing when this mechanism is set in motion, and the cosolvent diffuses into the aqueous phase, where it takes up some of the pesticides (forming a three-component phase near the interface). This is because the co-solvent continues to diffuse and dilute into the aqueous phase, rendering it incapable of retaining the pesticide in its dissolved state within the tricomponent phase. Thus, this pesticide causes the surfactant to supersaturate and separate from the water as nano-sized droplets, which are then quickly stabilized by the surfactant at the interface [80]. As shown in Fig. 3, nanoformulations’ superior physicochemical and biological activities cause the properties mentioned above [102].\n\n\n# 4.5 Advantageous of Nanoemulsion-Based Pesticide Formulations\n\nThe following benefits have increased interest in the use of nanoemulsion-based pesticides in agricultural farming:\n\n\n1.

Pesticides include fungicides, insecticides, nematicides, bactericides, and herbicides. Nonetheless, the use of synthetic chemicals is not suitable for the environment and human health. Biopesticides, including plant source-based and biocontrol microorganismbased, are highly desirable and more beneficial for crop protection. Nanomaterials have novel physical, mechanical, and chemical action [73]. Nanoparticles that come in contact with biological substances can receive a protein coating, which is called the corona effect, that results to enhance the interactivity of the nanoparticles with the cells modifying their mechanism of action in biological substances and having the capability to create toxicity [36, 82].\n\nMuch research has been put into establishing nano-based non-synthetic pesticides to benefit economic production by raising yield [65].\n\nNanoemulsions in pesticide formulation prevent plant disease from affecting economically significant crop yield and production. Nanoemulsions act as an agent that carries and transport biologically active metabolites and agrochemicals toward the target pathogen or phyto-pests [43]. The attractive physiochemical property of nanoemulsion is that a tunable nano size has developed a big surface area, enabling the functional mixture’s emergence, uptake, and accumulation to be highly effective than their counterparts [43]. To obtain better kinetic stability [56], slight surface tension, and better wettability for improved leafage adhesion [145] and enhance the dissolution and solubility of imperfectly water-soluble agrochemicals the active ingredients must be incorporated into the nanoemulsion. It can also work as a coating sheet for pesticides, providing ample protection from photodecay [105]. It was determined that antimicrobic nanoemulsions are many sturdy oil-in-water emulsions with nanometer-sized droplets (positively charged) consisting of extensive properties against fungi, bacteria, and viruses [103, 135, 136]. To effectively reduce plant diseases, nanoemulsion should be used for biologically active pesticides. The common pesticides nanoemulsion formulations are functional chemicals that can kill fungi (Fungicides), destroy insects like snails and slugs (insecticides), kill nematodes (nematicides), and kill weeds (herbicides) [102].",

TBZ consists of average leaching potency into groundwater [34]. It is a long-lasting pesticide with an adsorption constant $\\mathrm { K _ { o c } }$ (for organic carbon) range of about 803 and $1 2 5 1 ~ \\mathrm { m l / g }$ [98]. The systemic action mechanism of TBZ permits it to be consumed by plant roots and leaves to prevent the formation of ergosterol. This kind of impediment averted the synthesis of pathogens on the cell wall and reduced the germination of germ tubes [90]. [2] characterized and formed Eugenol nanoemulsion antifungal activities using Tween 20 (non-ionic surfactant) with water as a continuous aqueous phase on cotton. In vitro, antifungal assay demarcated that Eugenol nanoemulsion inhibits the growth of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum (which causes Fusarium wilt on important crops). Eugenol can inactivate important enzymes, which act on the cell membrane or interfere with nucleic acid activity [68]. Eugenol also blocks the ergosterol synthesis [30]. Nanoemulsion of Eugenol impedes radial growth and pigmentation, and sporulation of the pathogen [2]. Its mechanism of action is involved in the distortion of fungal mycelia. It has antimicrobial action against variable food-borne microbes [47], fungi toxigenic fungi [97], and phytopathogens [139]. Lemongrass and clove oil-based non-ionic nanoemulsion suppressed the growth and development of the vascular wilt-causing fungal agent Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici [124]. Da Silva et al.

It is very difficult to control nematodes; using insecticides is a good tool against them, but it has several negative impacts on living organisms and the environment. Developing an alternative pest management strategy that is equally effective as a synthetic pesticide and remains safe for the environment is essential. The greatest energy technique is characterized by its speed and efficiency in producing nanoemulsion with nano droplet diameters and small size dispersion [46]. Much research demonstrated that monoterpenes (the primary component of essential oils) are potent antibacterial agents in nanoemulsions [4, 5]. The nematicidal activity of a few nanoemulsions of monoterpenes, namely cinnamaldehyde, citral, geraniol, (R)-carvone, and pulegone, highly reduced egg hatching and increased juvenile mortality of root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne javanica [3]. The nematicidal activity of nanoemulsion dramatically impedes root galls, egg masses, and the population of $M .$ . javanica. The mode of action of monoterpenes and essential oils on nematodes is unknown (Abdelrasoul and Habashy 2021). However, many volatile oils have been found to exhibit carcinogenic activity in Drosophila melanogaster by activating octopaminergic receptors and destroying GABA receptors [38, 70]. Monoterpenes nanoemulsion enhances the mechanism of action of defense-related enzymes like polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase in tomato plants inoculated with M. javanica (Abdelrasoul and Habashy 2021). Therefore, monoterpenes nanoemulsion provides resistance against phytonematodes. Nanoemulsion obtained from Citronella oil potentially suppressed the development of the nematode population as effectively as a synthetic carbofuran-killed nematode [35].",

Ecofriendly substances attract much attention as an alternative to pesticides, and plant-derived products can produce defensive action against insecticides. Nanoemulsion obtained from the crude extract of fruits of Manikara subsericea effectively controls the cotton pest known as Dysdercus peruvianus. Essential oils significantly impact several stored grain insects by contact [20] and reacting by ingestion [40]. Nanoemulsion positively affects essential oils by improving their physical stability, bioactivity and water diffusion. The bioactivity and persistence of volatile oil nanoemulsion from Pimpinella anisum provide an innovative strategy for managing Tribolium castaneum, an economically important stored grain pest, and for managing many insects attacking stored products [55]. The fruits of Pimpinella anisum is a rich source of essential oils (Anisi aetheroleum) and proved to have an anti-convulsant, neuroprotective, anti-ulcer and anti-inflammatory response [60]. The chemical composition shows the presence of phenylpropanoids, with (E)-anethole (1-methoxy-4-(prop-1-enyl) benzene), p-anisaldehyde, chavicol and (E)-pseudoisoeugenyl 2-methylbutyrate [59]. The essential oil of $P .$ anisum and (E)-anethole were found to be very effective against larva as well as mature insects [114, 115] and showed fumigant impact on larvae of Lycoriella ingenua [111]. They displayed great efficacy on the Filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus [18], and displayed strong contact noxious impact against both sexes of Blattella germanica adults [146]. Aniseed oil-based nanoemulsion of $P .$ anisum provides insecticidal bioactivity. [99] reported that the increased toxicity of garlic oil nanoemulsion might be due to the increase in the emulsion droplet’s surface area, which leads to increased biological action and become more acricidal than normal emulsion. Nanoemulsion of Mentha longifolia oil increases the toxicant effect against Ephestia kuehniella and boosts the oil persistence time [86]. M. longifolia composed pulegone, p-menthan3-one-cis, 1,8-cineol, p-menthan-3-one-trans and $\\beta$ -pinene have great insecticidal properties. The ecofriendly nanoemulsion technique can be applied in storage houses to conserve foodstuff from insect damage [86].",

For example, Glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] is a non-selective foliage-sprayed herbicide to manage monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds species [122]. Glyphosate plays a major role in preventing the biosynthesis of phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine (aromatic amino acids) by ceasing the shikimate pathway, deactivating 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate synthase to slow down weed growth [130]. To minimize synthetic herbicides, the essential way is to help penetrate functional ingredients into leafage [63]. Nanoemulsion-based herbicides can increase the bioavailability of glyphosate, as the hydrated herbicide does not absorb, translocate and penetrate well into the waxy sheet of leaves [63]. They examined that green nanoemulsion formulation with water-soluble glyphosate effectively controls Eleusine indica. Natural herbicide nanoemulsion of Satureja hortensis actively eradicated two weed species: Chenopodium album and Amaranthus retroflexus. S. hortensis majorly contains chemical constituents such as $\\gamma$ -terpinene and carvacrol, which have herbicidal activity due to their phytotoxic effect [56] (Table 3).",

    "content": "# 6 Conclusion\n\nNanotechnology facilitates the production of active substances with nanoscale dimensions. Nano-pesticides offer various benefits beyond their mass equivalents, including (i) secure and straightforward management and less toxicity to non-target organisms, (ii) Higher pesticide effectiveness as a result of the regulated release and consistent surface distribution, (iii) reduced pollution and costs attributable to lower pesticide and toxic solvent concentrations. Nanopesticide formulations are regarded as an efficient method of pest control. Nanoemulsion is a feasible nanoformulation that can enhance pesticide formulations’ consistency, water dispersion, and bioactivity because nanoemulsion formulations may promote efficacy and eliminate synthetic pesticides. In the past few years, nanoemulsions have gained widespread popularity as a water-insoluble pesticide delivery technology due to their excellent efficiency, eco-friendliness, and safety.\n\nTable 3 Biocidal activity of various phytonanoemulsions-based pesticides   \n\n<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Nanoemulsionsource</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Biocidal activity</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Pathogen</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Keyreferences</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Allium sativum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Acaricidal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Eriophydae (eriophyid olive mites)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[99]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Azadirachtaindica</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Insecticidal(larvicidal)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Culex quinquefasciatus</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[10]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>A. indica, A.sativum, Lippiasidoides</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Insecticidal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Rhopalosiphum padi and Myzuspersicae</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[112]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ba-har essentialoil</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Fungicidal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Aspergillus niger, Colletotrichumgloeosporiodes, Peniciliumchrysogenum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[41]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bio-silica andCitronella</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Nematicidal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>(Meloidogyne spp.)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[35]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Carum copitum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Insecticidal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Sitophilus granaries and Triboliumconfusum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[155]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Chitosan coatednanoemulsion</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Nematicidal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[144]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cleome viscosa</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Fungicidal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Candida albicans</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[72]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cocos nucifera</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Herbicidal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Diodia ocimifolia</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[147]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Cymbopogon</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Insecticidal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Aedes aegypti</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[106]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Eucalyptusgloobulus</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Insecticidal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Tribolium castaneum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[110]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Eugenol</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Fungicidal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Aspergillus niger, Penicillium sp.,Rhizopus sp.</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[2]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Eugenol andMancozeb</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Fungicidal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Glomerella cingulata</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[125]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Jatropha curcas</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Insecticidal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Periplaneta americana</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[109]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Mentha longifolia</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Insecticidal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Ephestia kuehniella</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[86]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Nanoemulsion(X8W60PC)</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Fungicidal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>C. albicans, C. tropicalis, Microsporumgypseum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes,T. rubrum, Fusarium oxysporum,Aspergillus fumigatus</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[103]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Pimpinellaanisum</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Insecticidal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Tribollium castaneum and Culex pipiens</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[69, 104]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Satureja hortensis</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Herbicidal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Amaranthus retroflexus andChenopodium album</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[56]</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Thymus andMentha spicata</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Nematicidal andFungicidal</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Meloidogyne javanica</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>[54]</td></tr></table>\n\n\n# References\n\n\n1.

In this paper, a simplifed HPLC-based method has been developed for simultaneous quantitative determination of Pyriproxyfen and Bifenthrin in $1 0 \\%$ EC formulation using a C-18 analytical column $1 5 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m } \\mathrm { X } 4 . 6 \\ \\mathrm { m m } \\mathrm { X } 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ . Based on chromatographic separation with good resolution, acetonitrile: water (80:20, v/v) was selected as mobile phase in isocratic mode with a fow rate of $1 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { m L / m i n }$ at a constant column temperature of $3 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and UV detection at $2 2 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ . The method was validated in line with SANCO/3030/99 rev. 5 guidelines encompassing the key parameters system suitability, linearity, precision, recovery, LOD & LOQ. The validation parameters were found within acceptance criteria. The LOD and LOQ for Pyriproxyfen was $8 . 6 \\mathrm { m g / L }$ and $2 6 . 0 \\mathrm { m g / L }$ while that of Bifenthrin was $1 0 . 0 \\mathrm { m g / L }$ and $3 0 . 0 \\mathrm { m g / L }$ , respectively. Precision with acceptable $\\% { \\bf R } { \\bf S } { \\bf D }$ of $< 2 \\%$ and recoveries ranging from 80 to $1 2 0 \\%$ were obtained. Further escorting the decision making and confdence in the reliability of the produced data, measurement uncertainty using Eurachem/ CITAC procedure were obtained. The contributions to the uncertainty of measurement were from sample preparation, calibration standards preparation, calibration curve, and purity data. The contribution to the uncertainty of measurement from the analysis by HPLC were repeatability and intra-lab reproducibility. The combined expanded uncertainty of measurement was between $0 . 1 5 \\%$ and $0 . 1 9 \\%$ . The proposed analytical method is suitable for simultaneous quantitative determination of pyriproxyfen and bifenthrin in respective formulations.\n\nKeywords Method validation $\\cdot$ Combination formulation $\\cdot$ Bifenthrin and pyriproxyfen $\\cdot$ RP-HPLC $\\cdot$ Measurement uncertainty",

    "content": "# Introduction\n\nIn agriculture, the use of pesticides has played a crucial role in the amplifcation of agricultural production. To assure the crop producers that their crops are adequately well protected, this requires pesticide products to be of high quality which can provide efcient control of pests and plant diseases. Agriculture products of substandard quality may include imported or locally produced pesticides, especially the so-called generics, degraded, expired and other kinds of low-quality products. In addition, the problems in concern with adulteration is of great importance [1]. Mostly adequate standards of quality are not maintained by local formulators, maybe due to inexperience, inadequate facilities, and lack of technical knowledge. Hence, regular quality control of pesticides is essential to facilitate their safe and efcient use and to magnify agricultural productivity while at the same time protecting the farmers, consumers and the environment. The safety of pesticide products remains an issue of great worldwide concern [2–4]. Improper dosage and overuse of low-quality pesticides often contribute to the accumulation of obsolete pesticide stocks in the soils of developing countries [1, 5]. In developing countries, especially in Africa, approximately $3 0 \\%$ of pesticides marketed reportedly do not meet internationally accepted quality standards, which poses a serious threat [6]. Hence, Pesticide formulation analysis (PFA) is a crucial part in the pest control manufacturing process; modern agriculture to ensure that the pesticide formulation produced is efective, stable and safe for use meeting regulatory requirements [5].\n\nRegulatory authorities throughout the world are focused on monitoring the quality of pesticide products, particularly their active ingredient content. For complex formulations with multiple active ingredients and additives, more sophisticated instrumental techniques like chromatography, spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry might be necessary to achieve accurate and comprehensive analysis. The substandard pesticides can be detected by PFA, which gives farmers the right to take compensation from the company. Therefore, the future implications of pesticide formulation analysis are signifcant and safeguarding the crop’s health. PFA ensures production of quality pesticides from industries, which in turn helps scientists to carry out quality research while evaluating pesticides against insect pests before shortlisting them. It also creates trust among dealers and boosts their business [5].\n\nMoreover, methods employed for the determination of single active ingredients are basically not applicable to formulations with two or more active ingredients of that compound together with other pesticides. Therefore, utmost precautions should be taken while applying an analytical method to combination formulations. It has become a global requirement that laboratories accredited according to International Standard ISO/IEC 17025:2005 [7] contain the general requirements for technical competence. The analytical method should be ft for its intended purpose and fulfll the quality requirements in terms of recovery, precision, sensitivity and specifcity [1].\n\nNowadays new formulations containing two or more active ingredients are formulated to broaden the spectrum of activity; minimizing the tank mixing efort; making it convenient for farmers to use single formulation in their crop and making it cost efective [8]. However, there are only very few “multi analyte”/“multi pesticide” methods designed for simultaneous measurement of a wider range of pesticides. With the course of years, the composition of formulations is also changed but methods are not revised at the same pace to take these changes into account. Therefore, formulation control laboratories cannot utilize regular methods of analysis. Consequently, there is a great need for laboratories to have access to simplifed analytical methods that could be used under simplifed conditions but at the same quality and reliability of results [1, 5].\n\nCombined formulations of bifenthrin and pyriproxyfen represent a strategic approach to pest management that not only targets adult insects but also disrupts their development, thereby reducing the overall population. The dissipation studies of bifenthrin and pyriproxyfen combination formulation as $1 0 \\%$ EC under feld conditions have been reported in chili and brinjal crops along with the validation of analytical method for simultaneous quantifcation of bifenthrin and pyriproxyfen residues using modifed QuEChERS method and employing liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) [9].\n\nThe driving force in analytical method development has been the industry’s particular interest in specifc method for their respective formulations. So far as there is no universal HPLC method available for simultaneous quantifcation of bifenthrin and pyriproxyfen, for monitoring the batch-tobatch quality of the formulation, the present work was carried out to develop a unique HPLC based analytical method for simultaneous quantitative measurement of bifenthrin and pyriproxyfen in $1 0 \\%$ EC formulation. This method is most suitable and can easily be adopted on a commercial scale by any quality control laboratory in respective formulated products.\n\n\n# Materials and method",

    "content": "# Associated analytical uncertainty\n\nEvery measurement in an analytical method is associated with a dissipation known as measurement uncertainty (MU), giving a range of values of the measured within which the true value is expected to lie. Measurement uncertainty is a key indicator of both ftness for purpose and reliability of results. Measurement uncertainty plays a critical role in demonstrating compliance and scientifc basis for an analytical procedure that it meets legal requirements. Measurement uncertainty estimations were performed according to Eurachem/CITAC guide. In the present study estimation of MUs was performed using a top-down approach. For the identifcation of the source of uncertainties, the so called “Ishikawa or fshbone diagram” as in Fig. 2 was created.\n\nThe result of analyte concentration was mainly afected by calibration curve; sample preparation and method precision (repeatability and intra-lab reproducibility). The uncertainty associated with the calibration curve $\\mathsf { u } ( \\mathrm { C C u v } )$ covered the uncertainties with respect to purity and weight of reference standards (uCStd) along with the dilution measurements, i.e., pipettes and volumetric fasks as these infuences the uncertainty of the reported result. The tolerance and coverage factor $\\mathrm { ( k ) }$ used for pipettes and volumetric fasks was as given in their respective certifcates, along with the number of times used in the preparation of each standard solution. The uncertainty associated with the calibration curve was estimated using the regression variables and determined using the formula (5):\n\n$$\nu ( C C u \\nu ) = \\frac { S _ { r e s i d u a l } } { b } \\sqrt { \\frac { 1 } { r _ { C s } } + \\frac { 1 } { n } + \\frac { \\left( x _ { C s } - \\overline { { x } } \\right) ^ { 2 } } { S x x } }\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf { S } _ { r e s i d u a l }$ is residual standard deviation of the calibration curve and derived by using formula (6):\n\n$$\nS _ { r e s i d u a l } = { \\sqrt { \\frac { \\Sigma _ { \\mathrm { { i } = 1 } } ^ { n } { \\big [ } A _ { i } - ( b x \\mathrm { { i } } + a ) { \\big ] } ^ { 2 } } { n - 2 } } }\n$$\n\n$\\operatorname { A i } =$ peak area.   \n${ \\bf b } = { \\bf \\alpha }$ slope of calibration curve.   \n${ \\mathrm { a } } =$ intercept of calibration curve.\n\n$\\operatorname { r c s } =$ number of repeated measurements carried out for a given sample xcs.\n\n$\\mathbf { n } =$ the total number of calibration standards used for generating calibration curve.\n\n$\\mathbf { X } \\mathbf { C } \\mathbf { S } =$ analyte concentration depending on chromatographic method used.\n\n$( { \\bar { \\mathbf { X } } } ) =$ mean value of all the concentrations of calibration standards.\n\n$\\mathrm { x i = }$ is the target calibrator concentration at the i-th level.\n\nFig. 2 “Ishikawa or fshbone diagram” for identifying the sources of uncertainty in quantifcation of Pyriproxyfen and Bifenthrin in the formulation\n\n$\\mathbf { S } \\mathbf { X } \\mathbf { X } =$ is the sum of squares deviation of $\\mathbf { X }$ given by $\\begin{array} { r } { S _ { x x } = \\sum \\left( x _ { i } - \\overline { { x } } \\right) ^ { 2 } } \\end{array}$\n\nThe estimation of uncertainty associated with the method precision $\\mathbf { u } ( \\mathbf { S } _ { \\mathrm { P r e c } } )$ with respect to repeatability and intra-lab reproducibility of the results were derived using a pooled standard deviation (Sp) approach by using formula (7):\n\n$$\nu \\left( S _ { P r e c } \\right) = \\frac { S _ { p } } { \\sqrt { r _ { c s } } }\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm { S } _ { p }$ is calculated as in formula (8):\n\n$$\nS _ { P } = \\sqrt { \\left( \\frac { \\Sigma _ { i } \\left( \\nu _ { i } \\times s _ { i } ^ { 2 } \\right) } { \\left( \\Sigma _ { i } \\nu _ { i } \\right) } \\right) }\n$$\n\nvi is the degrees of freedom of the i-th sample, si is standard deviation of the i-th sample and rcs is the number sample replicates.\n\nFor uncertainty due to sample preparation (uSprep), it combines the inaccuracies of all measuring equipment (e.g., weighing balance and volumetric fasks) and a reference certifcate coverage factor of 2. The combined uncertainty, uc, is obtained by combing all the individual uncertainty components as in formula (9):\n\n$$\n\\frac { u _ { c } } { x } = \\sqrt { u _ { r } \\big ( C _ { s t d } \\big ) ^ { 2 } + u _ { r } \\big ( C _ { C u r } \\big ) ^ { 2 } + u _ { r } \\big ( S _ { P r e c } \\big ) ^ { 2 } + u _ { r } \\big ( S _ { p r e p } \\big ) ^ { 2 } }\n$$\n\nFinally, the expanded uncertainty (U) is calculated by multiplying the coverage factor $( k = 2 )$ at a level of confdence $9 5 \\%$ by the combined uncertainty: ${ \\pmb U } = { \\pmb k } \\times { \\pmb u }$\n\nTable 9 shows the obtained results associated with individual uncertainties of the sample preparation $( \\mathrm { u } \\mathrm { S } _ { p r e p } )$ , calibration standards preparation $( \\mathrm { u C _ { \\mathrm { s t d } } } )$ , calibration curve $( \\mathrm { u C _ { C u r } ) }$ , method precision $( \\mathrm { u } S _ { \\mathrm { p _ { r e c } } } )$ , combined uncertainty (uc) and expanded uncertainty (U) in accordance with the EURACHEM Guide, investigated in this paper. The histogram results, as in Fig. 3, showed minimum infuence of the uncertainty obtained from sample preparation and calibration curve on the combined uncertainty for both analytes, pyriproxyfen and bifenthrin. The contribution of calibration standards and method precision showed nominal magnitude in both cases. The uncertainty value of the test method calculated for pyriproxyfen and bifenthrin were $0 . 1 5 \\%$ and $0 . 1 9 \\%$ w/w with a $9 5 \\%$ confdence level. The proposed analytical method for the determination and quantifcation of pyriproxyfen and bifenthrin in EC formulation was found to be simple, swift, linear, precise, accurate and robust. Hence, this method can be adapted for routine analysis conveniently.",

Further, green solvents, i.e., acetonitrile and milli-Q water, with minimal reagents use, make this method superior and suitable for various analytical applications. Statistical validation parameters and recovery data reveals high accuracy and precision of the method along with good separation and resolution of chromatographic peaks. Hence, we conclude that the method developed for simultaneous determination of pyriproxyfen and bifenthrin can be used efciently by commercial laboratories for routine quality control analysis. Furthermore, estimation of measurement uncertainties associated with the analytical determination would be helpful while deciding the compliance of the results.\n\nFig. 4 Pictorial graph of Z-scores\n\nTable 10 Grubbs test for outliers   \n\n<table><tr><td></td><td>Minimum</td><td>Maximum</td><td>Mean</td><td>Std. deviation G</td><td>(Observed value)</td><td>G (Critical value) Alpha (1%)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Pyriproxyfen</td><td>10.289</td><td>10.394</td><td>10.332</td><td>0.050</td><td>1.241</td><td>1.764</td><td>1.764</td></tr><tr><td>Bifenthrin</td><td>9.830</td><td>9.954</td><td>9.880</td><td>0.061</td><td>1.210</td><td>1.764</td><td>1.764</td></tr></table>\n\nAcknowledgements We acknowledge our extended gratitude and thanks to the Management of Shriram Institute for Industrial Research, Delhi, for providing the facilities and support.

If mites do not come into direct contact with the pesticide solution on leaves, the efficacy cannot be achieved. Controlling the particle size can potentially play a crucial role in the manifestation of efficacy. In this study, high-throughput formulation technology was used to systematically screen a large number of adjuvants to obtain cyetpyrafen formulations. The particle size of the active ingredient in the formulation was measured. By examining the dynamic light scattering and contact angle, we simulated the actual process of the efficacy transmission of cyetpyrafen formulations against Tetranychus cinnabarinus. Our results showed that the activity of cyetpyrafen increases as the particle size decreases, suggesting that reducing the particle size can enhance the coverage and deposition on crop leaves, and further improve the dispersion efficiency and enhance spreading capabilities. Furthermore, controlling the particle size at $1 6 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ resulted in an $\\mathrm { L C } _ { 5 0 }$ value of 0.2026, which is approximately double than that of the commercial product. As a novel pesticide for mites, our study presents the most effective cyetpyrafen formulation in practice. Our findings provide valuable insights into controlling other mite species that pose a threat to agricultural products.\n\nKeywords: high-throughput formulation technology; size effect; cyetpyrafen; pesticide formulation; efficacy",

However, in the form of acaricidal compounds, increased doses of application have led to a high level of mite resistance to cyetpyrafen [2,3]. The application of the cyetpyrafen compound mainly relies on dispersion transfer and interface transfer; however, it lacks inherent uptake and systemic translocation activity for efficient use in practice. Most research has focused on developing new efficient acaricidal compounds with novel modes of action, which is time-consuming and costly [4]. Thus, exploring alternative strategies to enhance the efficacy of formulations in acaricidal compounds is highly warranted.\n\nIn most cases, pesticide formulations are formed via manual large-scale adjuvant combinations to meet the formulation’s usability. With the advancement of automation technology, especially the rapid development of robotics, high-throughput technology, as a new rapid development technique of the 21st century, has been widely applied to medicine screening [5]. However, due to factors such as the high cost of advanced equipment investment and the limitations of thinking patterns, high-throughput formulation technology is relatively uncommon in practice. Currently, many studies focus on using a single type of adjuvant or a class of adjuvants to modify the structure, thereby altering the particle size and surface tension [6]. Screening and regulating the proportions of adjuvant systems on a large scale require substantial manpower and resources, involving multiple manual screening steps, and result in obtaining only a limited number of formulations with different sizes within a relatively long research and development period [7,8]. Moreover, research on the relationships between changes in the particle size of non-systemic pesticides due to complex adjuvant systems and various influencing factors during the transmission process warrants further investigation.\n\nPrevious studies have indicated that the conventional spraying of acaricidal formulations may not achieve comprehensive coverage of leaf surfaces, leading to the aforementioned issues with the effectiveness of the pesticide [9]. The main objective of this study is to find the particle size key to maximize the efficacy of acaricidal compounds without systemic activity. We hypothesize that size effects can impact the uniformity of the formulation dilution, drift losses during the spraying process, and the amount of active ingredient reaching the leaves [10]. The transfer processes of these three aspects are indeed key factors that influence the efficacy of the cyetpyrafen compound.\n\nWe utilized HTPS (high-throughput preparation and screening), a fully automatic high-throughput agrochemical formula preparation and screening system, specifically designed for pesticide formulations. It is an advanced approach that enables the rapid screening and evaluation of a large number of different formulations simultaneously. This innovative technique utilizes automated processes to test various combinations of ingredients, optimizing the formulation development process and accelerating the identification of optimal formulations for specific applications. It revolutionizes the traditional formulation approach by significantly reducing the time, cost, and resources required for formulation experimentation, ultimately leading to an improved efficiency and efficacy in the development of new products.\n\nThe impact of the particle size effect on the dosage transmission process is evaluated and analyzed using the dynamic light scattering index TSI [11]. Additionally, the dynamic contact angle changes from some existing research are combined for a comprehensive analysis of the liquid dosage transmission process of acaricidal compounds without systemic activity [12]. The study identifies the optimal effective ingredient particle size range and distribution of cyetpyrafen formulations during the dispersion transmission and interface transmission processes. Furthermore, indoor potted plant experiments were conducted using different-sized cyetpyrafen formulations to investigate mite mortality rates [13]. The present study has not only validated the practical applicability, but also identified the optimal range of ingredient particle size for cyetpyrafen formulations in the most effective way.\n\nResearch on acaricidal pesticide formulations holds significant importance. By understanding the particle size of active ingredients and its impact on efficacy, researchers can develop more effective and targeted acaricides [14]. This, in turn, can lead to improved pest control measures, increased crop yields, and reduced economic losses caused by mite infestations. Furthermore, advancements in pesticide formulation research can contribute to sustainable agriculture practices by minimizing the use of harmful chemicals and optimizing the effectiveness of pest management strategies [15].\n\n\n# 2.

Influence of the Size Effect on the Uniformity of Diluted Formulation\n\nCombining the appearance evaluation obtained from LEA PolyView and the particle size data obtained from Helos Quiexl, typical formulations were selected, and their particle size data are shown in Table 1.\n\nThe initial step in the application of a cyetpyrafen formulation is the dispersion process, where the active ingredient is diluted with water to form the liquid formulation. In this study, a dynamic light scattering analyzer was used to analyze the uniformity of cyetpyrafen formulations with different particle sizes. The variation in backscattered light intensity and transmitted light intensity over time were analyzed, enabling the detection of particle motion phenomena with cyetpyrafen formulations with different particle sizes [16].\n\nTable 1.

As the detection time extended, the backscattered light intensity of the three parts of the sample tube continuously changed to indicate the uniformity of the particle motion. The variation in the curve was used to determine the changes in the system [17].\n\nUltimately, the TSI of the sample was quantitatively calculated. This index was derived from the raw data measured using the instrument, obtained directly from the backscattered light and transmitted light signals, and could characterize the degree of non-uniformity of the cyetpyrafen formulation sample [18].\n\nA higher TSI value indicates a less uniform system. Figure 1 shows that as the particle size decreases, a significant decrease in the TSI was observed, indicating an improvement in the uniformity of the spray solution. The Brownian motion characteristics of the spray solution particles were measured using a dynamic light scattering instrument [19]. According to Stokes’ formula, the velocity of the particles undergoing Brownian motion was inversely proportional to their particle size.\n\nFigure 1. TSI values and curves.\n\nFurther, combined with the transmitted and backscattered light spectra, an analysis of Further, combined with the transmitted and backscattered light spectra, an analysis the non-uniformity phenomenon was conducted. Due to the opaqueness of the cyetpyrafen formulation, we used backscattered light for the analysis. The right side of the backscattered light fingerprint represents the top of the sample cell, while the left side represents the bottom. From Figure 2, it can be observed that the backscattered light intensity shows significant fluctuations on the right side of the spectra. Specifically, sample L1–8 exhibits a clear upward peak between $3 8 \\mathrm { m m }$ and $4 1 \\mathrm { m m }$ , indicating an increase in local particle concentration and the formation of particle aggregates. This suggests that the uniformity of L7–81 is noticeably weaker than that of L1–8, where the backscattered light intensity remains uniform within the same range [20].\n\nFigure 2. Backscattering light spectra (BS): (a) L1–8 sample; (b) L7–81 sample.\n\nuence of the Size Effect on the Contact Angle The determination of the backscattered light was conducted using Turbiscan Lab with near-infrared light as the light source. With the variation in the sample incubation time, both the transmitted light and backscattered light underwent changes due to the sample’s instability. This indicates alterations in the particle size and concentration, thereby characterizing its instability.\n\nng properties. The contact angle hysteresis (advancing contact angle and receThere was a certain relationship between the particle size of the diluted formulation tact angle) reflects the likelihood of a liquid sliding off the surface and is mainly deand Brownian motion. Smaller particle sizes (L1–8) exhibited a more pronounced irregular ned based on the number of added surfactants in the pesticide solution, guidingmotion due to thermal agitation. These smaller particles had a higher surface area-to-mass earch on formulation enhancement [8]. In this study, by adding equal amounts of ratio, resulting in more frequent collisions with surrounding molecules. Conversely, larger tants, we assumed and simulated that all droplets effectively fell on the leaves.

Influence of the Size Effect on the Contact Angle\n\nAn important process of cyetpyrafen formulation application involves interfacial transfer, specifically the process of droplets falling onto leaves, and adhering and permeating the leaf surface [22]. The contact angle is the most direct indicator of wetting and spreading properties. The contact angle hysteresis (advancing contact angle and receding contact angle) reflects the likelihood of a liquid sliding off the surface and is mainly determined based on the number of added surfactants in the pesticide solution, guiding the research on formulation enhancement [8]. In this study, by adding equal amounts of surfactants, we assumed and simulated that all droplets effectively fell on the leaves. We investigated the permeation and conduction ability of different-sized cyetpyrafen formulations on the leaf surface within $1 0 \\mathrm s$ for six typical sizes of cyetpyrafen formulations [23].\n\nAccording to the analysis and calculations using advanced software, the dynamic changes in the wetting and spreading process, and contact angle within 10 s were obtained and are shown in Figure 3. To calculate the degree of change in the contact angle at a fixed time, the circle fitting method was used to calculate the contact angle. From Figure S1, it can be observed that with an increase in particle size, the magnitude of the change in the contact angle decreases. Among them, L1–8 (with a particle size of $1 6 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ ) exhibited the steepest slope, indicating the largest decrease in the contact angle within $1 0 ~ \\mathrm { s }$ and the strongest wetting and spreading ability. In contrast, for L7–81 (with a particle size of $1 5 \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ , the needle position was no longer at the center of the droplet, indicating that the liquid had already started rolling on the leaf. This occurrence may lead to the possibility of the liquid rolling off the leaf during the actual application process, significantly affecting the efficacy [24].",

    "content": "# 2.3. Influence of the Size Effect on the Indoor Pot Efficacy and Deposition\n\nTo verify the parameters in the liquid transfer process and ensure the reliability of the selected formulations, we conducted pot seedling spray tests on nine samples and the commercial product cyetpyrafen $3 0 \\%$ SC (the brand name and source of the reference formulation is a commercially available product, CORRE™) to evaluate their efficacy against Tetranychus cinnabarinus. The results are shown in Figure 4.\n\nFrom Figure 4 and Table S1, it can be observed that the overall trend shows an increase in $\\mathrm { L C } _ { 5 0 }$ values and a gradual decrease in efficacy as the particle size of the cyetpyrafen formulation increases. Particularly, when the particle size exceeds $5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } ,$ , there is a significant increase in $\\mathrm { L C } _ { 5 0 }$ values, indicating a notable decrease in efficacy. Considering indoor activity from a single factor, as the particle size decreases, the acaricidal activity of cyetpyrafen formulation gradually increases. When the particle size is $0 . 3 9 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , the $\\mathrm { L C } _ { 5 0 }$ value is the lowest, indicating that its efficacy is twice as high as that of the current commercial product, cyetpyrafen SC.\n\nTo investigate the mechanism by which changes in formulation size affect the enhancement of efficacy, we selected six representative samples that have been characterized for uniformity and contact angle. By measuring the deposition and coverage of the spray after application on the six selected samples, we described the differences in the number of particles per unit area on target crops for different particle sizes. This allowed us to determine the varying impact of size changes on deposition and infer the pattern of efficacy changes [25]. As shown in Figure 5 and referring to Table S2, it is observed that the number of visible liquid droplets on the water-sensitive paper gradually decreased with the increase in particle size, leading to a corresponding decrease in the deposition amount. Among these, the L1–8 sample exhibited the highest number of visible liquid droplet depositions per unit area, with a deposition amount of $0 . 9 8 ~ \\mu \\mathrm { L } / \\mathrm { c m } ^ { 2 }$ , significantly higher than the other samples.\n\nFigure 3.

This implies easier contact between the mites and the solution, thereby enhancing the efficacy. We can draw the conclusion that the reduction in particle size enhances the coverage of the l product cyetpyrafen 30% SC (pesticide on the target crop leaves.\n\nFigure 4.

The preliminary findings indicated the impact of the size effect on the eDispersion transfer: The uniformity of the diluted formulation is characterized using acy as follows: the dynamic light scattering theory. As the particle size decreases, there is a significant decrease in the TSI, indicating an improvement in the uniformity of the spray solution. This enhanced uniformity leads to improved dispersion efficiency, which in turn contributes to an enhancement in efficacy. When the particle size was smaller than $1 . 4 8 \\mu \\mathrm { m } .$ , both the TSI and backscattered light spectrum indicated better dispersion efficiency and improved uniformity of the sample. This was more advantageous for the efficacy to be exerted.\n\nInterface transfer: Based on the results obtained from dynamic contact angle measurements, it is evident that the reduction in particle size significantly influences the wetting and spreading of a pesticide spray. Smaller particle sizes lead to an increased surface area, facilitating better wetting and spreading of the spray solution on target crops or surfaces. This enhanced wetting and spreading promote improved contact between the pesticide and the target organisms, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the pesticide [27].\n\nConsidering the aforementioned conclusions, it can be preliminarily deduced that reducing the particle size offers potential benefits in improving efficacy. When considering the optimal values for indoor bioactivity assays, it was observed that a particle size of $1 6 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ for the cyetpyrafen formulation achieved the highest level of biological activity. Currently, when the particle size is further reduced beyond the scope of this study, it becomes challenging to obtain formulations on a large scale. In future work, further exploration of formulation techniques can be conducted to investigate the activity patterns of acaricides at even smaller sizes.\n\n\n# 3. Materials and Methods",

Each sample was applied to the target Tetranychus cinnabarinus at concentrations of 2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125 ppm [31].\n\nThe bioactivity of the 10 samples against Tetranychus cinnabarinus was determined using a foliar spray method on potted seedlings. First, adult Tetranychus cinnabarinus mites were placed on citrus leaves, and the stable mite population was counted as the initial count.

    "content": "# 4. Conclusions\n\nWe characterized the influencing factors in terms of efficacy expression and studied the final biological activity. The findings showed that the particle size of the active ingredient was correlated with the efficacy of cyetpyrafen. Furthermore, the activity of the cyetpyrafen formulation increases with decreasing particle size. The results of deposition indicate that smaller particle sizes result in higher deposition amounts per unit area and an increased coverage of the formulation. Additionally, reducing the particle size can improve dispersion efficiency and enhance spreading capabilities. Moreover, controlling the particle size at $1 6 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ yielded an $\\mathrm { L C } _ { 5 0 }$ value of 0.2026, approximately twice that of the commercially available product. This study established a new approach for considering particle size effects as a variable in determining efficacy across the consecutive processes of dispersion transfer and interfacial transfer. Simultaneously, this work explored the possibility of transitioning pesticide formulation research from a random and simplistic theoretical guidance approach to a systematic and intelligent research mode. This laid the foundation for a new model and platform in agricultural chemical formulation research based on big data. In general, reducing the particle size enhances the coverage of the pesticide on the target crop leaves and improves its penetration capability on the crop surface. According to Stokes’ law, when the particle size decreases, the solid particles in the pesticide solution disperse more uniformly, resulting in an increased coverage by the pesticide solution [32]. It is important to note that this study focuses on cyetpyrafen formulations as an example, using particle size control to address issues related to the optimal particle size range and the impact of size effects on rheological properties and dispersion stability, which could provide a theoretical basis for future formulation efficacy studies.\n\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28217432/s1, Figure S1: Contact angle value within $1 0 \\mathrm { { s } ; }$ ; Figure S2: Ternary adjuvant systems of HTPS; Figure S3: Distribution of adjuvant systems in HTPS: (a–g) 84 ternary adjuvant systems plates; Figure S4: Relationship between different ternary adjuvant systems and particle sizes; Figure S5: Appearance of 84 cyetpyrafen formulation samples prepared using HTPS; Table S1:Efficacy against Tetranychus cinnabarinus of nine samples and the reference sample; Table S2: Deposition results; Table S3: List of the source of adjuvant; Tables S4–S7: Unitary adjuvant systems (library 1–4 plate); Tables S8–S14: Ternary adjuvant systems (library 1–7 plate).\n\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Y.W., J.C. and L.Y.; methodology, L.Y. and Q.Z.; software, J.C.; validation, L.Y., H.L. and Q.Z.; formal analysis, J.C.; investigation, Y.W.; resources, J.C.; data curation, H.L.; writing—original draft preparation, L.Y.; writing—review and editing, J.C. and L.Y.; visualization, L.Y. and M.Y.; supervision, Q.Z.; project administration, Y.W.

    "content": "# 1. Introduction\n\nCrop productivity has experienced an important increase since the middle of last century (Dyson, 2000), as a result of better soil and water management, improved plant varieties, application of fertilizers and the use of pesticides (Cooper and Dobson, 2007). In the particular case of pesticides, the main beneficial effects of these products have been associated with the control of agricultural pests, having other indirect positive consequences such as the reduction of fungal toxins, and control of invasive species. Besides these positive aspects some negative characteristics have been observed, being the impact on the environment and human health the ones with more conspicuous repercussions. Despite these negative aspects, farmers continue to apply these products, in some countries in increasing quantities. This fact could be partially explained by the short term economic profit that derives from their use (Wilson and Tisdell, 2001), although at present concerns about sustainable use of pesticides are a matter of discussion between producers and regulatory authorities.\n\nAs mentioned above, one of the main negative effects of pesticide use is their effect on human health. In this respect it is well known that farm operators in particular are some of the most exposed subjects, especially when the pesticide application is done without the proper protection (Lesmes-Fabian et al., 2012). In an investigation done on 6300 cases with manual sprayers in 24 different countries, the effect of pesticide use on human health was studied (Tomenson and Matthews, 2009), finding that $1 . 2 \\%$ of the operators experienced serious agrochemical related incidents (with hospitalization), while $5 . 2 \\%$ of the total users had a moderate incident which required medical intervention. In another international study analyzing 8500 cases of operator's attitude and behavior regarding the use of pesticides (Matthews, 2008), in 26 different countries, it has been established that only $5 0 \\%$ of the operators used gloves during the mixing stage of the concentrated pesticide. This occurred despite the recommendations of using personal protective equipment during this operation (International Labour Organization-WHO, 1991), perhaps because of climate stress factors such as high humidity and temperature (Park et al., 2009). In the same sense, in a study done among farmers in the Philippines, Lu (2009) has pointed out that $3 1 . 8 \\%$ of the operators interviewed have experienced spillage on their hands.\n\nThe pesticide exposure risk is particularly important in small horticultural (Ramos et al., 2010) and floricultural (Flores et al., 2011) production units surrounding Buenos Aires city. There, working conditions are unfavorable, associated with lack of education, low technology and highly manpower-dependent tasks. In these cases we have previously shown that the mixing and loading operations could constitute a considerably risky stage. It has been pointed out that the type of pesticide formulation can modulate the toxicological effects on non-target systems and affect the pesticide's environmental fate (Cox and Surgan, 2006). In particular, for human exposure, the influence of the formulation type on dermal absorption has been studied from experimental (Aust et al., 2007) and modeling (Krüse and Verbek, 2008) perspectives. Moreover, it has been established that insecticides with the same active ingredient but different formulation have different biocide actions (Moreno et al., 2008).\n\nDespite being recognized that the type of pesticide formulation may affect the operator's exposure (Damalas and Eleftherohorinos, 2011), to our best knowledge no quantitative analysis has been made studying the factors that modulate the exposure risk from this point of view. In this sense, the survey described in this report studied the exposure to pesticides under real working conditions in horticultural and floricultural production units and under controlled laboratory situations, analyzing the effect that the pesticide formulation has on the operator's exposure.\n\n\n# 2.

The amount measured out was weighed in a portable scale before transferring it to the tank. After closing the tank and container, the gloves were taken off and placed in separate bags (right or left hand) and then taken to the lab for analysis. The spoons used in experiences H4–H8 (solid formulations) were collected individually and placed in extraction flasks for analysis.\n\nIn the cases where the pesticide content on the outside of the commercial containers was measured, the external surface of the container was rubbed with a piece of tissue paper soaked in acetone or cyclohexane.

The dashed lines represent the mean values of log $\\%$ PME) for each of the aforementioned groups. These results seem to indicate that under the same conditions, solid formulations were safer than liquid ones, during the mix and load step. Additionally, the significant differences found for the log $\\%$ PME) between different types of formulations (HSF vs HLF, Fig. 1) for the same activity could be an indication that the type of formulation has a more important effect on the exposure than the kind of agricultural activity (HLF vs. FLF, Fig. 1), when the mix and load operation is considered.\n\nThe Margin of Safety (MOS) was calculated for each case in order to determine if a single operation was safe or not. The values were represented as logarithm of the MOS in Fig. 1B, which means that unsafe operations (with ${ \\tt M O S } < 1$ ) have $\\log \\mathrm { M O S } < 0$ (Fig. 1B). As expected, it can be observed that the risk estimation is strongly affected by the toxicological properties (AOEL) of each active ingredient. In any case, 11 of the 23 cases studied were unsafe for a single mix and load operation, emphasizing the risk associated with the manipulation of concentrated pesticide mixtures.\n\nFig. 2 shows the values of the MOS of the mix and load stage, expressed as its logarithm, for each type of activity, formulation (HSF, HLF, FLF, Fig. 2) and pesticide (captan, procymidone, deltamethrin, endosulfan, Fig. 2). Calculations were done considering one, two and four backpack sprayer preparations, using the mean values of $\\%$ PME and mean mass manipulated for each activity and pesticide. It can be observed that while the preparation of one backpack was a safe operation for procymidone and deltamethrin, when two backpacks were considered, deltamethrin resulted unsafe, and for the mix and load of four backpack sprayers, which is a common labor duty for a journey (Ribeiro et al., 2012), all the considered pesticides resulted in unsafe operations.\n\nFig. 1. A) % PME of horticultural and floricultural workers in the mix and load stage. B) MOS of horticultural and floricultural workers in the mix and load stage for a unique mix and load operation.\n\nFig. 2. MOS for the mix and load stage for one, two and four backpack sprayer preparations.\n\nAn interesting consideration derived from the field trials results, is that there seems to be a lateralization effect for the solid formulations (right hands $0 . 0 1 4 \\pm 0 . 0 1 7 \\%$ , left hands $0 . 0 0 2 \\pm 0 . 0 0 2 \\%$ , Table 1). This fact could be partially explained by the observation that most operators hold the pesticide container with their left hand while approximating a spoon to the mouth of the pesticide container, frequently reaching with their hands into the top of the container, which usually had pesticide deposited all round the inside.\n\nAlthough none of the operators involved in the field determinations normally used protective gloves when they mix and load the pesticide, these results would be considered as a worst case scenario, because we cannot state that this is the situation for all horticultural and floricultural operators in Argentina.",

The dye concentration was selected as $2 0 \\%$ because this was the low end of the range of commercial solid pesticide formulations. PME experiments were performed with volunteers manipulating the same mass of powder or granulated surrogate (Table 2). After simulating a mix and load activity (see Methodology section), the amount of dye remaining on the gloves was spectrophotometrically determined. For the powder manipulation a mean value of $0 . 0 1 3 \\pm 0 . 0 1 1 \\%$ of the total dye handled (Table 2) was found on the gloves, which is in the order of what we detected in the case of the horticultural operators who handled solid formulations $0 . 0 2 \\pm 0 . 0 2 \\%$ , Table 1). For the granulated preparation, all values were below the analytical detection limit, which indicates that the granulated formulation was safer than the powdered one.\n\nFor this set of experiments, the residues of dye in the spoons used to transfer the formulation from its original flask to a specified beaker were determined. Table 2 presents the results for the residual amounts found for the powder manipulation $( 0 . 2 9 \\pm 0 . 1 5 \\%$ , Table 2) and the granulated one $( 0 . 0 2 9 \\pm 0 . 0 3 5 \\%$ , Table 2). The granulated formulation left much less residue of active ingredient on the spoons (practically one order of magnitude less). This could be of importance in reducing field-operators' exposure, as the reutilization of these implements without proper cleaning is commonly observed in the field.\n\nIt is interesting to remark that the mix and load operations performed at the laboratory, yielded similar total $\\%$ PME values to the field experiments (Tables 1 and 2). Unlike the field values, the lateralization effect was less evident, due to the fact that the spoons used under laboratory conditions were in all cases clean. On the other hand, the kind of solid formulation (powder or granulated) had an important effect on the $\\%$ PME and on the amounts found in the spoons used to manipulated it.",

Differences between field and laboratory experiments\n\nHaving found that for liquid formulations, the total $\\%$ PME seemed to be greater in field experiments (Table 1) than under laboratory conditions (Table 3), a potential missing factor in the exposure mechanism was suggested.\n\nA possible explanation could be related to the “history of containeruse”; this is that in field trials, operators used pesticide containers that had been repeatedly employed (e.g. for Decis, $2 { - } 5 ~ \\mathrm { m L }$ doses taken from a $2 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { m L }$ container), while in laboratory experiences, volunteers always used new and clean flasks. Therefore, we measured the pesticide amounts found in the exterior surfaces of a set of used containers collected from horticultural farms, some of which were still in use while others had been discarded. Table 4 shows the pesticide mass found (in mg) on the exterior surface of each container. It should be noted that the real values are probably higher, as the residues were sometimes dried and encrusted, in which case swabbing was not quantitative (see Methodology section for details). The container set included different formulated products (Starfos: chlorpyrifos, Shooter: chlorpyrifos, Talone: chlorotalonyl, Endoglex: endosulfan, Sumilex: procymidone, Decis forte: deltamethrine, Trigermin: trifluralin, Daconil: chlorotalonyl, Thionex: endosulfan, Table 4), all of which were analyzed on the exterior of each container.\n\nIt is interesting to note that not only the expected ingredient of each container was found on the exterior surface, but practically in all cases (with the exception of $\\mathbf { M } _ { 7 }$ , Table 4) the rest of the studied pesticides were also found. In most cases $( \\mathsf { M } _ { 1 } \\mathrm { - } \\mathsf { M } _ { 3 }$ , $\\bf { M } _ { \\mathrm { 6 } } { - } \\bf { M } _ { 9 }$ , Table 4) the main product corresponded with the contents, but in some cases $( \\mathrm { M } _ { 4 } , \\mathrm { M } _ { 5 }$ , $\\mathbf { M } _ { 1 0 } ,$ Table 4) the main pesticide found was different. This fact could be explained by the general unsafe storage conditions of these products, which could have contributed to pesticide transference from the exterior of one container to another.\n\nThe second interesting feature is that the pesticide amount found in certain cases (M6, $\\mathrm { M } _ { 8 }$ , $\\mathsf { M } _ { 1 0 }$ , Table 4) was really important (above several milligrams) raising the possibility that an important transfer of pesticide from the exterior surface of the container to the worker's hands could occur just by handling the container.",

The contamination level of the spoons used to take the solid pesticide from the container was also lower for granulated than powdered formulations, emphasizing the benefits of this kind of preparation (from a risk-control point of view).\n\nWhen the total $\\%$ PME associated to the handling of liquid formulations was studied, the breaking of the aluminum seal of the containers, and the color or the formulation solutions appeared as important steps in the exposure of the operator's hands, possibly indicating that the operators' risk assessment can include behavioral components that could be mitigated with simple measures. The measuring vessel and the container size seem to play a less important role in the exposure mechanism.\n\nThe difference between the $\\%$ PME in field and laboratory experiments for liquid formulations may be partially explained by the significant amount of pesticide found in the exterior surface of used containers that could imply a pesticide transfer from the container's exterior to the operator's hands.\n\nThese results indicate that although formulations are optimized for the best physicochemical performance when being applied, the mixer's potential exposure should be taken into account when a product, and its container, are designed and approved for use.\n\n\n# Conflict of interest\n\nWe declare that there is no conflict of interest in the authors associated to this paper.\n\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nThis work has been financially supported by the Universidad Nacional de General Sarmiento, INTA (PNHFA 063411), and OPCW.

The assets of a nanoencapsulated pesticide formulation are controlled releasing properties with enhanced solubility, specificity, permeability and stability. They provide in-built switches to control the release and subsequent availability of pesticides to be used effectively over a given period of time and their design enables them to resist the severe environmental processes such as leaching, evaporation, photolytic hydrolytic and microbial degradation over conventional pesticides.

    "content": "# 1. Introduction\n\nChemical control remains the primary control measure for agricultural pests and diseases because of its quick effect and high control efficacy [1–5]. The unreasonable use of chemical pesticides has significantly burdened the ecological environment and seriously damaged the ecological balance [6–9]. The utilization rate of pesticides is only $2 0 { - } 3 0 \\%$ because of the splashing, drifting, and evaporation of droplets during spraying; less than $1 0 \\%$ reaches the target botanic leaves [10]. The low utilization rate and the enormous loss of pesticides pose a serious threat to the safety of soil and agricultural products. Using traditional spray equipment causes runoff, emissions, dripping, and leaking phenomena, resulting in the loss of pesticide droplets to non-target areas [11–16]. Efficient, less toxic, safe, and environmentally friendly botanical pesticides are required to replace chemical pesticides [17–24].\n\nThe botanical pesticide matrine is a quinoline pyridine alkaloid. It has good application prospects in medicine and pesticide development [25–29]. In the field of pesticides, matrine is mainly formulated as a soluble concentrate (SL). Although this formulation is safe and convenient to use, its deposition rate of droplets on the surface of plants is poor; thus, it is difficult to achieve an ideal result [30]. Oil dispersion (OD) has recently attracted attention as an efficient and safe new formulation. This formulation has good wettability and spray performance and can significantly improve the deposition of droplets on the target surface to achieve synergistic results [31–33]. To obtain the best bioactivity, improve spraying efficiency, and save water and pesticides, it is necessary to use efficient pesticide-spraying technology.\n\nAs a new spraying technology, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) sprays have the advantages of high efficiency, economy, and safety [34–36]. Compared with traditional pesticide-application technologies, UAVs can spray pesticides in fields with different terrains, landforms, and crops of different heights. This significantly reduces the labor intensity of plant protection and improves operation efficiency [37]. A strong penetration force is generated from the high-speed downward rotation and high consistency of the rotor wings to ensure that the liquid rapidly and evenly wets the crops when applying pesticides. This improves the utilization rate of pesticides and saves water and pesticides. The operator is located at a distance from the pesticides and crops; the remote operation of pesticideapplication equipment ensures that the pesticide is completely separated, improving the safety of pesticide-application personnel [38–40]. Traditional ground spray agents cannot be directly used for UAV spraying, which makes the droplets slip and rebound [41].\n\nTo develop matrine products suitable for aerial control and improve the application range, application efficiency, and adaptability of matrine, we prepared three types of matrine OD using methyl oleate as the solvent oil and VO/02N, VO/03, and VO/01 as emulsifiers. We evaluated the stability, wettability, and spraying performance of these matrine OD samples. OD samples with good stability and comprehensive performance were screened out; this significantly improved the uniformity of the sprayed pesticides and increased the coverage area of the target surface, thus reducing pesticide use. This may improve the application potential of matrine in aerial spraying.\n\n\n# 2. Results",

OD Formulation and Optimization Preliminary Screening of the Emulsifier\n\nEmulsifiers are essential additives used to improve the performance and reduce the cost of pesticides. They can ensure not only emulsification but also dispersion and wetting. They help pesticide particles evenly disperse in pesticide systems, prevent the aggregation of pesticide particles, protect suspension systems, and improve the uniformity of pesticides. Emulsifiers can also enhance the stability of pesticide formulations and prolong the residence time of pesticide particles on target crops, thereby strengthening the control effect [42]. An appropriate emulsifier plays a vital role in the performance of OD. In this study, we used VO/02N, VO/03, and $\\mathrm { V O } / 0 1$ emulsifier samples. The appearance, $\\mathrm { p H } ,$ and active ingredient content of each sample before and after room temperature $( 2 5 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ cold storage $( 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } \\pm 1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ , and hot storage $( 5 4 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } \\pm 2 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } )$ are listed in Tables 1 and 2. There were no significant differences between the formulations with emulsifiers VO/02N, VO/03, and VO/01. The decomposition rate of the active ingredients was less than $5 \\%$ , indicating that the matrine OD samples prepared with these three emulsifiers had high stability. The three emulsifiers were used to prepare the formulation. The follow-up experiments used these three additives as emulsifiers.\n\nTable 1.

Screening of the Thickener Dosage\n\nThickeners are mainly used as additives to improve the viscosity and rheological properties of pesticide formulations and the persistence and adhesion of pesticide droplets on plant surfaces. They can enhance the performance and stability of pesticides. By strengthening the system’s spatial structure, fluidity, and dispersion, precipitation in the solution is difficult. This improves the effect of pesticides [43]. The optimum amount of thickener directly affects the performance of OD. The changes in our formulation before and after hot and cold storage are listed in Tables 3 and 4. When the thickener dosages were $3 . 0 \\%$ , $2 . 5 \\%$ , $2 . 0 \\%$ , or $1 . 5 \\%$ , the hot-storage stability was qualified, and the active ingredient decomposition rate was less than $5 \\%$ , the requirements of GB/T 19136-2021 for the thermal storage stability of pesticide preparations were met. The formulation produced a yellow-to-brown turbid liquid and a precipitate that could not be dissolved when the dosage was $1 . 0 \\%$ .

Conclusions and Discussion\n\nIn this study, a specially purposed matrine OD that could be used for aerial pesticide applications was prepared using different emulsifier types and dosages. The optimal emulsifier type and dosage for the formulation were screened using single-factor tests, and the best formulation of matrine OD was obtained. Through the test results of the storage stability, multiple light scattering stability, suspension rate, particle size and distribution, SST, ${ \\mathrm { D C A } } ,$ viscosity, droplet density, and coverage of the formulation, we observed that the trial performance was the best when the dosage of the three emulsifiers was $8 \\%$ Emulsifier VO/03 demonstrated the best performance. The optimized formula for matrine OD was determined as follows: $2 5 \\mathrm { ~ g ~ }$ $( 1 0 \\% )$ matrine TC, $2 0 \\ \\mathrm { g }$ $( 8 \\% )$ emulsifier (VO/03), $3 . 7 5 \\mathrm { g } \\left( 1 . 5 \\% \\right)$ organic soil, $5 \\ : \\mathrm { g } \\left( 2 . 5 \\% \\right)$ white silica, and $2 5 0 \\mathrm { g }$ solvent oil (methyl oleate). The formulation has broad application prospects, including an ultra-low-volume and drone spray. Compared with the matrine SL developed by Li et al. [48], the use of OD could significantly improve the uniformity of spraying pesticides and increase the coverage area of the target surface, thus providing the possibility of reducing the use of pesticides and reducing the risk of pesticide pollution in the environment. The findings of this study provide a theoretical basis and technical guidance for selecting pesticide formulations and adjuvants, as well as an important strategy for applying oil suspensions in environmentally friendly pesticides. This may also provide a new method for specific formulations suitable for UAV crop protection.\n\nThe suspension rate after hot storage was slightly higher than before, which may have been caused by an error during sampling. The specific mechanism and factors require further study.\n\n\n# 4. Materials and Methods",

This requires good wettability of the liquid droplets. The common method to determine the wettability of pesticide droplets is to determine the DCA of droplets on a solid surface [52,53]. Matrine OD was diluted with deionized water into 50-fold, 500-fold, and 1000-fold aqueous diluents. A drop of diluent was taken using a needle with an inner diameter of $\\varphi = 0 . 8 \\mathrm { m m }$ , and a drop was dropped every $5 \\mu \\mathrm { L }$ . The DCA was measured every second using an optical contact angle measuring instrument (DSA-100, KRUSS, Germany). The DCA was measured for $0 { \\mathrm { - } } 4 \\operatorname* { m i n } .$ , repeated four times at $2 0 \\pm 1 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C } ,$ and photographs of the droplet shapes were taken at the 0, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th min.",

    "content": "# Abstract\n\nEnvironment pollution related to pesticides has been confirmed by the scientific community for a long time, but the available information on the impact of this phenomenon on human health and the ecosystem are still insufficient. Contamination of the environment can occur through various pathways, ground deposits during the application of pesticides to crops are one of those pathways. The retention rate of sprayed droplets is an important factor both for the efficacy of the phytosanitary treatment and the quantities of lost pesticides on the ground. This paper presents an overview of factors that affect spray droplet behavior, involved process in sprayed drop fate and the mainly techniques for measuring pesticide deposits to the ground and plant retention. We present studies that have focused on pesticide retention and soil deposition during crop spraying in relation to sprayer equipment, used formulation and climatic factors. Plant retention and pesticide deposits during spray is a complex problem depending mainly on physical sprayer parameters, climatic conditions, spray properties and chemical formulation. By illustrating the large variety of analytical methods during the recently years, it aims to explain that it is always possible to assess the impact of pesticides in all compartments of the environment. The use of concerned molecules and natural collectors is the safest to evaluate the real situation, but the use of tracers and artificial targets is both very reported and safety for the environment.\n\nKeywords: pesticide application, plant retention, soil deposits, measuring, environmental factors",

    "content": "# 1. Introduction\n\nPesticides are used in plant protection to improve agricultural production and to produce a good yield. The poor efficiency of the spraying process leads to economic losses, environmental contamination, reducing in biological efficacy of the applied pesticide. Public authorities’ preoccupation with those problems has increased significantly during the last few years, particularly in relation to both health and environmental risks. One of the main causes of this problem could be the pollution of the environment by transferring polluting agents from crop-growing areas to natural resources, via different pathways. The maximization of the spray retention on plants and the reducing of the off-target losses is one of the key remedies for both preserving the environment and improving the effectiveness of plant protection. During spraying, the small droplets are not retained by the plant and are drifted by the air. Large droplets, also, cannot adhere to the leaf, because they runoff from the surface after bouncing or shattering and are retained by lower leaves surface or will deposit on the soil (Cox & al., 2000).\n\nBahrouni (2010) showed that in winter wheat, in the Tunisian context, soil deposition of pesticide under plants, vary from 46 to $9 2 \\%$ of the sprayer rate (for details, see Table 1), while the retention is only 5 to $2 9 \\%$ . Graham-Bryce (1977) found that retention rate, $\\mathrm { i n } \\%$ of the dose/ha, was only $0 . 0 3 \\%$ for the “Dimethoat” on the bean and $2 . 9 \\%$ when applying “Disulfaton” on wheat. According to Gyldenkaerne et al. (1999), depending on the growth stage of BBCH (Note 1), soil deposition of pesticide in spring barley can reach $8 4 . 8 \\%$ of volume / ha. On cereals, BBCH Stage 10-19, Becker et al. (1999) estimated the retention at $2 5 \\%$ of the applied dose.

Involved Factors in Spray Droplet Deposition in the Soil and Their Retention on Plants\n\nThe high spray retention on the target leaves is a solution to achieve better result in more uptake by the plants and less pesticide wasted into the environment. On the other hand, the biological efficacy of the pesticide is depending of the active ingredients which is influenced by the behavior of the droplet on the leaves surface. This means that the droplet size spectrum of a spray application is an important factor affecting the efficiency and the deposition of the spray application. It strongly determines the drop behavior on plant and their fate. That’s why, the British Crop Protection Council (BCPC) and American Society of Agricultural Engineers (ASAE) have classified agricultural sprays based on droplet size. Thus, several studies have been carried out by the scientific community around the world to study parameters affecting retention on plants and deposits on the ground which are strongly resulting from the droplet properties. Droplets pesticide emission during application is controlled by many factors such as physical equipment parameters, climatic conditions, physiochemical properties of the formulation and target surface properties. But they can be divided into two mainly categories: technical and environmental factors. According to Teske et al. (2002), the parameters affecting the deposition of the droplets are spray pressure, liquid flow rate, air velocity and shear across the atomizer, spray physical properties (viscosity, specific gravity and surface tension) and atmospheric conditions. Wilson et al. (2003) added drop velocity and diameter resulting from equipment parameters (forward speed, nozzle, rate, pressure, etc.), spray formulation properties (dynamic surface tension, dynamic viscosity, etc.) and target surface characteristics (leaf angle, hydrophobicity, growth stage, etc.). Recently, Massinon and Lebeau, (2013) found that the parameters affecting spray deposition are nozzle type and size, the volume applied per hectare, the formulation, the used surfactant, the plant architecture, the leaf surface, the leaf orientation, the contact angle, the wettability and the surface tension. Hewitt et al. (2001) studied the effect of liquid properties and nozzle design on drift potential, and they confirmed that adjuvant has a direct effect on the break-up of spray through nozzle type, droplet size distribution and drift potential. Wolf et al. (2004) demonstrated that the air induction nozzles provide a coarse spray that increased deposition on vertical and horizontal artificial targets like cereal canopy, also the increasing spray angle between double nozzles increased spray deposits on vertical artificial targets. Nuyttens et al. (2007b)\n\nconfirmedd that the ide al nozzle preessure combinnation will m aximize sprayy efficiency ffor depositing and transferrinng a lethal dosee to the target,  while minimizzing off-target t losses such ass spray drift annd user exposuure.\n\nIn an earliier study, Furmmidge (1962)  recognized thhe importance of plant propperties in runooff phenomenoon of droplets onn leaf surface  of the vegetatiion. Forster et al. (2005), M ercer et al. (20007) found thaat droplets beh avior on the plannt is strongly aaffected by thee roughness annd the inclinatiion angle of thhe leaf. This is  determined byy two factors: thee leaf area ind ex (LAI) and tthe leaf cuticlee wax, which vvary from plantt growth and pplant canopy.",

De Ruiter et al. (1990) explained that the most important factor affecting the deposition is the nature of the cuticular surface (crystalline epicuticular waxes, hairs, edges, veins, roughness, hydrophobicity, etc.). Mechanisms for the wetting of leaf surfaces by agrochemicals are reviewed in Taylor (2011). The wettability of leaves surface depends on the hydrophobicity of the leaves structure influenced by the growth stage, the position of soybean leaves and this potentially influences the performance, selectivity and compatibility of foliar pesticides applied. Moreover, the adjuvants formulations can overcome the low wettability. So, the wetting of leaf surfaces has long been known to govern retention and been the subject of numerous theoretical studies on lotus effect or superhydrophobicity. The contact angle of the droplet decreases from being advancing to receding and the droplet will lose energy and recoil due to surface tension. The droplet lost by drop rebound have to be limited or avoided although their negative effects can be reduced or absent in very dense canopies (species, growth stage and surface wettability), an optimal drop impact energy should be found to limit undesirable effects.",

    "content": "# 3. Involved Process in Spray Droplet Deposition in the Soil and Their Retention on Plants\n\nMany researchers developed mathematical models to describe droplet impact on leaf surfaces to understand spray crop retention process (Becker et al., 1999; Forster et al., 2005; Gyldenkaerne et al., 1999; Olufsdotter & Streibig, 1997; Cox et al., 2000). New parameters have been added to the spray droplet adhesion model developed by Forster et al. (2005) and improved by Nairn et al. (2013) to a process-driven spray retention model including leaves hairs parameters. Another model was established by Massinon et al. (2017) and the outcomes as computed from logistic regression models related to the Weber number define the destiny of the droplet when reaching a surface. Forster et al. (2012) determine the destiny of a droplet in four patterns: deposition, retention, uptake and translocation.\n\nWhen the droplet impinges on plants, they experience different behaviors associated with impact, rebound, splash, slide, retention, evaporation, adsorption on the target surfaces (Jia & Zhu, 2015). The three outcomes of the droplet impacting a leaves surface are potentially adhesion, rebound or shatter, depending on the kinetic energy of the released droplet from the nozzle determined by the mass and the velocity (Boukhalfa et al., 2014). Authors concluded that for an optimal spray retention, the droplets that impact the plant surface must remain on the plant and the volume percentage of adhering droplets will be maximized. The rebound and shatter could also contribute to final retention (Zwertvaegher et al., 2014).\n\nThe volumetric proportions of adhesion on first impact alone are not enough to accurately predict retention and the method needs improvement to measure other variables, such as diameter, velocity and reflection angle from rebounding and secondary droplets, needed to improve retention models (Zwertvaegher et al., 2014).\n\nMaximizing pesticide application efficiency requires therefore good control of droplet size and velocity distributions. Mechanisms for the adhesion, retention, to bouncing and splashing of the spray droplet on leaf surfaces and the different droplet regime (Wenzel sticking, Cassie and Baxter wetting regime, etc.) are reviewed by Boukhalfa et al. (2014).\n\nThe Weber number is an important factor leading to a modification on the impact of the droplet to the target surface. The Weber number $( W e )$ is defined as the dimensionless ratio between droplet kinetic energy in the normal direction to the surface and its surface energy:\n\n$$\n\\mathrm { W e } = { \\frac { \\rho ( \\mathrm { V n } ) ^ { 2 } \\mathrm { D } } { \\delta } }\n$$\n\nwhere $\\rho$ is the liquid density, $V n$ is the normal droplet velocity to the impacted surface, $D$ is the droplet diameter and $\\sigma$ is the formulation equilibrium surface tension (Zwertvaegher et al., 2014).\n\nIf the losses energy is low enough, the droplet will bounce or rebound of the leaf, but if the energy is great, the droplet adheres. If the losses are too great then insufficient energy remains for rebound and the droplet adheres (Forster & al., 2012). If a droplet hits the surface with high energy on the surface tension of the leave can’t maintain it, the drop can shatter into finer droplets (Mercer et al., 2007). The droplet reaches its maximum spread when the kinetic energy is converted to potential energy.",

A good tracer must be easily and highly recovered from both artificial and natural targets. The ideal tracer is a substance that can be visualized in the dry and can be recovered quantitatively from the natural or artificial surface (Palladini et al., 2005). Many types of tracers have been used to simulate the deposition of pesticides on the studied collectors with and without the addition of the non-ionic surfactant. The selection of the tracer to be used must consider the following important criteria: a high sensitivity to detection, quickly quantitative in analyzes, solubility in the spray mixture, low significant effect on sprayed droplet, can be analyzed by the equipment, stable, nontoxic, and with a moderate cost (Yates & Akesson, 1963). The recovery of the tracer deposit rate is assessed by comparing the amount of measured tracer to the amount of applied tracer and may be affected by dye degradation (sun exposure), background deposits (substances with properties similar to the natural dyes emitted by the leaves) and the process of extraction. Cerqueira et al. (2012) reported that the selection and reliability of quantitative analyzes methods for spray deposits depend on the target nature, tracer substance, and target-tracer interactions.\n\nThe quantitative methods to assess spray deposition of different types of tracers are colorimetry, fluorometry and spectrometry.",

    "content": "# 4.1.1 The Fluorescent Tracers\n\nThe fluorescent tracer dyes are widely used in researches studies to evaluate the amount of droplet deposit on and out the target area because of their very low level of detection. First uses were related by Speelman (1971) and Barry (1978). These tracers are not analytically expensive compared to the extraction and the chromatographic analyzes of pesticides, also the fact of being less harmful during the experiments. Palladini & al. (2005) employed a fluorescent pigment under ultraviolet light (UV) to assess the amount deposited on leaf. Fluorescent pigments used as tracers are not water soluble and require the addition of surfactants, which reduce the surface tension of the solution.\n\nThe fluorescents tracers like Brilliant Sulfo Flavine (BSF), Fluorescein, Eosine, Caracid, Brilliant Flavine, Tinopal, Pyranine, Rhodamine A, Uvitex, Uranin are analyzed by spectrofluometry (Nuyttens et al., 2007b)\n\nThe weakness of these tracers is their sensibility to the light. Most of the fluorescent dyes are sensitive to light and photodegraded during exposition to solar radiation. Thus, it is necessary to verify the recovery and stability of the tracer on the target collector prior to the start of the experimentation.\n\nCai and Stark (1997) tested several fluorescent dyes and concluded that the BSF had the better performance. It was selected as the best tracer to replicate the comportment of pesticide during atmospheric spraying, since its degradation is only $1 1 \\%$ after 8 hours of exposure to sunlight. This dye was then used by several authors (see for instance, Holterman et al., 1997; Gil & Sinfort; 2005).\n\nTracers have many other advantages that have been the subject of several researches. For example, Hewitt & al. 1994 showed that fluorescent dyes Rhodamine and BSF do not influence the droplet size spectra during spray evaluation measurement. Also, Palladini et al. (2005) proved that the Brilliant Blue and Saturn Yellow mixture at $0 . 1 5 \\%$ is stable under all tested conditions, not absorbed by the leaves surface and maintained the same surface tension as that of water.",

Tartrazine was used also to assess deposition on vineyard and artificial vineyard to evaluate the efficacy of spray equipment (Codis et al., 2013).\n\nThe dye degradation, and adsorption propriety of tracer on plant can be a problem, and generate errors in evaluating the deposition on the plant, different experimentation of recovery must be preceded. To remedy this anomaly, Teske et al. (2002) used pesticide Chlorpyriphos with and without florescent tracers to determine the droplet size after impact on different types of crops leaves. In this spirit, Cerqueira et al. (2012) used a mixture of tracer pesticide (Tebuconazole) with fluorescent dye (Rhodamine B, Brilliant blue), Metal ions (Cobox) and Sodium chloride (Salt) to compare spray deposit on different crops with an artificial paper filter target.

    "content": "4.2 Chemical Analyzes\n\nThe sequence steps in pesticide analyzes are matrix modification, extraction, clean-up and determination. The sampler is first drawn through an adsorbent, then the molecule is extracted and analyzed.\n\nTo measure low concentrations highly selective, sensitive and accurate, analytical methods are needed. In recent years, the two analyzes techniques conventionally used are Gas Chromatography (GC) and Liquid Chromatography (LC) associated with different selective and sensitive detectors, such as Mass Spectrometry (MS). These most often involve separation techniques that rely on a difference in behavior of the components to be analyzed between a mobile phase and a stationary phase. Gas chromatography (GC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is one of the most common methods for the determination of pesticide concentration in the environment (De Rossi et al., 2003). The components are extracted and analyzed by GC using a detector. Most GC methods employ element-selective detectors such as electron capture detector (ECD), nitrogen-phosphorus detector, flame photometric detector, electrolytic conductivity detector and microwave-induced plasma-atomic emission detection (Chen et al., 1996). GC-MS/MS is a powerful tool for the identification and quantification of pesticides in complex matrices during application and for post-application emissions. This technique has a better sensitivity and provides much more information on the components than in simple mass spectrometry or GC coupled with other detectors such as ionization flame (FID). It has already been used for the quantification of pesticides in the soil (Frenich et al., 2005), in the air (Miller et al., 2000) and in vegetables (Carabias-Martínez et al., 2007). Several investigators have studied different sampler types from different matrices for GC/MS analyzes (Meghesan-Breja & Morar, 2012; Lozano et al., 2012). They all agree that concentrations of analyzed components depend strongly on the sampler and on sampling conditions, regardless of the origin of the sample.\n\nSo, besides the use of official methods, many laboratories develop and validate their own method for pesticide residues analyzes because depending on the analytical technique chosen, different approaches for sample treatment may be considered. Even when using the same technique, different equipment or equipment settings can be selected, making it difficult to reach a universally accepted analytical method.\n\nFor example, Meghesan-Breja (2012), developed a fast GC-MS method for 70 pesticides identification and quantification from soil. Carabias-Martínez et al. (2007) used a specific method to determine triazines in potato, carrot, lettuce, bean, zucchini and orange. Another group of researchers managed to extract 29 carbamates from dried fruits (raisin, prune and mango), spices (turmeric, masala, sage, thyme and red pepper) and from soybean paste and soy sauce (Terada et al., 2008).",

In the literature, the measurement of the leaf area index could be direct, for example by using an optical planimeter (Alem et al., 2002), or indirectly by measuring the light energy incident under the leaves with a radiometer.

To measure the amounts of deposits on weeds, the method was to cut the entire plant which acted then as a collector. Foqué et al. (2012) used filet paper collectors (FPC) to monitor spray distribution and penetration in the canopy by using leaf fertilizers. The FPC are used as artificial targets because of their uniformity in size, absorpting properties and non-waxy surface. The FPC have the properties to be less susceptible to bouncing of droplets than real leaves and they give a better indication of the efficacy of the spray application technique to reach a certain location in a crop (Foqué et al., 2014).\n\nThe extraction coefficient is generally higher for artificial targets, except for the Brilliant Blue tracer, for filter paper collector, lower than the limit $( 8 0 \\% )$ of extraction established by (ANVISA, 2008) for validation of the analytical methods. The use of artificial collectors for spray characterization is well known using all collector types was useful to properly characterize the sprays and to quantify the differences between each collector type for coverage and droplet density (Ferguson, 2016).",

    "content": "# 4.3.3 Water Sensitive Paper (WSP)\n\nThe water sensitive paper is another type of artificial collector to perform a qualitative assessment of deposits. It is an excellent collector to test sprayer set-up, but does not gives an idea about the efficacy of the formulations, retention and coverage proprieties on crop surface. Halley et al. (2008) used a combination of treated wheat heads and water sensitive paper to compare various application parameters for treating wheat heads. Salyani et al. (2013) used WSP to assess the spray distribution on crop and proof the limitations of WSP in characterizing spray droplet distribution and deposition in field application. The small droplets are easily measured on WSP collector than the larger droplets, higher volume rate. The measurement of droplet size spectra can be conducted using non-intrusive laser equipment or with a variety of droplet collection and measurement systems. According to Hoffmann and Hewitt, 2005, the WSP can be used as a method for assessing the droplet size spectra and deposition quality for agrochemicals application. They are used also to visualize and quantify spray distribution deposed from terrestrial or/and aerial applications. The spray droplet leaves a blue stain on the yellow surface of WSP which coated with a layer of bromoethyl blue during treatment with water contact. The WSP are usually employed to quality the distribution of different configurations of types of sprayers, nozzles, pressure on vegetation (Nuyttens et al., 2004). The WSP will turn blue under high humidity conditions more than $8 5 \\%$ . The blue stain created by a water droplet is larger than the actual droplet due to spreading in a leaves surface. Therefore, a spread factor must be used to calculate the actual droplet that created a particular stain size (Hoffmann & Hewitt, 2005). The WSP does not require a fluorescent dye tracer in the mixture and can be analyzed by software to yield droplet data but the WSP spoil easily at high humidity and do not capture very well small droplets less than $5 0 ~ { \\mu \\mathrm { m } }$ .\n\nThe droplet deposit on WSP can be measured with Image analyzes system software (Salyani et al., 2013). The WSP cards droplet scan is processed with CCD camera, software program Droplet Scan and Swath Kit. The results given by analyzing of the WSP with the three imaging systems are comparable (Fritz et al., 2009).\n\nThe droplet spectra on WSP are analyzed with specialized imaging equipment and software.",

    "content": "# 4.3.4 Polyethylene Collectors\n\nThe spray impact behaviors on superhydrophobic leaves surface can be measured on an artificial superhydrophobic surface like in (Massinon & Lebeau, 2012). The authors employed an artificial superhydrophobic surface composed of complete polytetrafluoro-ethylene (PTFE) coated microscope slide blade to measure spray deposition on wheat and barley leaves. Some others used and confirmed the efficacy of many others artificial targets like as glass slides, strings, monofilament lines, mesh screens and plastic soda straws (Martin et al., 2014).\n\nForster et al. (2014) tested other artificial collectors to assess plant retention (Mylar sheet, water sensitive paper, steel plate, a plastic Petri dish). They found that all those targets were poor indicators of adhesion and retention on natural plant surfaces. Garcerá et al. (2012) used the white PVC sheet as artificial collectors of the spray solution formulations tested to assess the drop retention behavior on citrus leaves due to their similarity of skins and drop distribution pattern. This collector was also used by Codis et al. (2013) as a leaves crop of the artificial vineyard to assess the efficacy of spray equipment used in spray protection. The two teams approved a good recovery rate for this artificial target.\n\nDespite these results, which favor the use of artificial collectors, Hewitt (2010) has a different opinion. He explained that these artificial targets should not be substituted the natural plant surfaces in field trials for assessing spray crop retention. He thought that the wettability differences between artificial targets didn’t have been considered in many studies.",

    "content": "# 5. Conclusion\n\nThis review article shows the importance of pesticides ground deposits on the pollution of the environment and the necessity to understand the plant retention mechanisms to limit the deposit rate. Retention efficiency of spray droplets is a complex problem depending mainly on physical equipment parameters determining strongly the droplet size, climatic conditions, physiochemical properties of the diluted spray formulation and surface characteristics of the target plant. Depending on the interaction of those parameters, the possible outcomes of droplets impacting the leaf surface are potentially adhesion, rebound or shatter. So, their fate can be retention, slide on the soil, evaporation or adsorption on the target surface. To better understand the phenomenon, modelling could be a suitable solution, but more efforts should be directed toward studies to characterize the complicated interaction between spray droplets and plants considering the different involved parameters.\n\nTo directly measure pesticides deposits, through natural or artificial collectors, Gas Chromatography coupled with tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) is one of the most common used methods. However, because of the danger of the active substances and the requirement of meticulous and expensive laboratory analyzes, tracer and dyes are commonly recommended to replicate the comportment of pesticides. But in this case, it is required to determine the efficiency factor of the combination tracer/collector and to validate the method. If the collector is the plant leaves, it is very important to consider the Leaf Area Index. Brillant Sulfo Flavine was selected by several researchers as the best tracer because of its performances and its adaptabilities to be used with different types of targets.",
