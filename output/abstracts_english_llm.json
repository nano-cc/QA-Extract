    "abstract": "Herbal medicines have been used for centuries to treat diverse health conditions and are increasingly sought after as people pursue natural, holistic care. Growing global concerns about the safety of herbal formulations, however, demand rigorous evaluation for contaminants such as heavy metals, aflatoxins, pesticides, and microbial pathogens. This study assessed the safety and quality of a polyherbal formulation developed for the management of uterine fibroids. Comprehensive screening included inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for heavy metals (arsenic, lead, mercury, cadmium), liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for aflatoxins, gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) for pesticide residues, and standard microbial assays for total viable counts and pathogenic organisms. Results showed heavy metal and aflatoxin levels within acceptable limits, no detectable pesticide residues, and minimal microbial load with no pathogens. These findings align with WHO and API standards, confirming the formulation’s safety and supporting its suitability for preclinical and clinical evaluation in uterine fibroid management."

    "abstract": "Formulation and adjuvant technologies can facilitate the use of insecticides that have higher biological efficiency application features. Safety, physicochemical properties by increasing consumer demand for safe food and enhancing operator safety. The aim of this current work was to develop a green efficient, and stable pesticide formulation. Therefore, certain nano emulsions with and without Adjuvants Calcium Alkyl Benzene Sulphonate (Atlox 4838B), and non-ionic surfactant based on trisiloxane ethoxylate (ARGAL), were testing against Sitophilus oryzae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Certain analytical techniques were used for determining the characterization of the nano emulsions (Sesame, Clove, and Cinnamon). Results showed that all formulations were penal, achieving nanometric size for all compounds. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrographs revealed spherical or quasi-spherical morphologies for the tested nanoemulsion formulation nanodroplets. Furthermore, dynamic light scattering (DLS) showed that the particle size of the formulation with the adjuvants showed a slight increase in the droplet size compared to the formulations without adjuvants. In comparison to the tested nanoemulsions with adjuvants, the viscosity of the nanoemulsions without adjuvants was lower. All studied formulations, both with and without adjuvant, showed an acidic to slightly acidic pH, except for sesame (NE) with AtloxTM 4838B, which showed a neutral pH, and they were kinetically stable with no phase separation, creaming, or crystallization. Furthermore, supporting the stability of these nanoemulsion particles was the absence of a separation phase following centrifugation, freeze– thaw cycles, and heating–cooling cycles. Findings proved that ARGAL and Atlox 4838B adjuvant stabilized NE by increasing Brownian motion, weakening the attractive forces with smaller droplets, increasing the value of zeta potential and polydispersive index $( < 0 . 6 ) ,$ , and decreasing surface tension. The bioassay technique using film residue to estimate LC50 values on S. oryzae adults indicate that Clove, Sesame, and Cinnamon nano emulsions with Atolx adjuvants were the most effective against S. oryzae adults under laboratory conditions, where the LC50 Values are 0.022, 0.032 and $0 . 0 3 5 \\mu \\mathsf { L } I$ $\\mathsf { c m } ^ { 2 }$ respectively after $2 7 \\mathsf { h } _ { \\iota }$ , or exposure time. Clove, Cinnamon, and Sesame nanoemulsion (NE) with $\\pmb { 0 . 0 1 \\% }$ (w/w) adjuvant exhibited remarkable insecticidal activity against S. oryzae L., of 100, 100 and $9 7 . 5 \\%$ respectively by in vitro assay."

    "abstract": "Pesticides include chemicals as well as biological and physical agents used to control a diverse array of pests. Although a number of occupational and non-occupational situations affect the extent and route of exposure to pesticides, most skin effects are associated with a relatively small number of compounds. The highest exposures and risk of dermatitis involve individuals employed in agricultural pest control operations. The degree of pesticide contact may be lessened by use of protective clothing and engineering controls such as closed mixing and loading systems.\n\nFor evaluating the effects of pesticides on the skin, the most relevant tests include dermal absorption tests, the 72 hr. Draize dermal irritation study, and sensitization studies. For the Draize irritancy test, a general protocol utilizing albino rabbits is provided. Suggested concentrations are also given for sensitization studies using the patch test methodology.\n\nRegistries for monitoring pesticide-related illness exist in numerous US and worldwide jurisdictions. The most complete historical data derive from the California Pesticide Illness\n\nSurveillance Program. This chapter briefly presents data on illnesses associated with individual classes of pesticides and pesticide mixtures, discussed separately as five categories (antimicrobials, fumigants, fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides), focusing on the principal causes of pesticide dermatitis reported in medical literature and in California use and surveillance data between 1982 and 2014."

    "abstract": "The rapid reduction in agricultural production caused by various pests and diseases necessitates researching and designing novel, efficient, secure and ecofriendly formulations of pesticides. In agricultural farming, pesticides are used to efficiently manage pests and diseases, resulting in higher food production, reduced food waste, and increased farmer profit. Unfortunately, over $90 \\%$ of pesticides drain into the environment and persist in agricultural products, causing environmental pollution, which are major drawbacks of a chemical-based traditional pesticide formulation. In the past few years, nanoemulsion-based pesticides have been developed to be effective, nontoxic, cost-effective, and possess excellent physico-chemical stability and greater biodegradability. For this purpose, there is a great interest in the design of efficient nanoemulsion-based pesticide formulations. Two normally immiscible liquids (water and oil) are combined in these formulations to produce an isotropic system. This chapter discusses various scientific concerns and approaches, including preparation method, composition, characterization, and biological properties pertaining to developing nanoemulsion-based pesticide formulations."

    "abstract": "In the manufacturing process of pesticide formulations, quality control plays a crucial part in ensuring its efectiveness and meeting requirements of regulatory for safe use. In this paper, a simplifed HPLC-based method has been developed for simultaneous quantitative determination of Pyriproxyfen and Bifenthrin in $1 0 \\%$ EC formulation using a C-18 analytical column $1 5 0 \\ \\mathrm { m m } \\mathrm { X } 4 . 6 \\ \\mathrm { m m } \\mathrm { X } 5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m } )$ . Based on chromatographic separation with good resolution, acetonitrile: water (80:20, v/v) was selected as mobile phase in isocratic mode with a fow rate of $1 . 2 ~ \\mathrm { m L / m i n }$ at a constant column temperature of $3 0 ~ ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ and UV detection at $2 2 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ . The method was validated in line with SANCO/3030/99 rev. 5 guidelines encompassing the key parameters system suitability, linearity, precision, recovery, LOD & LOQ. The validation parameters were found within acceptance criteria. The LOD and LOQ for Pyriproxyfen was $8 . 6 \\mathrm { m g / L }$ and $2 6 . 0 \\mathrm { m g / L }$ while that of Bifenthrin was $1 0 . 0 \\mathrm { m g / L }$ and $3 0 . 0 \\mathrm { m g / L }$ , respectively. Precision with acceptable $\\% { \\bf R } { \\bf S } { \\bf D }$ of $< 2 \\%$ and recoveries ranging from 80 to $1 2 0 \\%$ were obtained. Further escorting the decision making and confdence in the reliability of the produced data, measurement uncertainty using Eurachem/ CITAC procedure were obtained. The contributions to the uncertainty of measurement were from sample preparation, calibration standards preparation, calibration curve, and purity data. The contribution to the uncertainty of measurement from the analysis by HPLC were repeatability and intra-lab reproducibility. The combined expanded uncertainty of measurement was between $0 . 1 5 \\%$ and $0 . 1 9 \\%$ . The proposed analytical method is suitable for simultaneous quantitative determination of pyriproxyfen and bifenthrin in respective formulations."

    "abstract": "Cyetpyrafen is a compound that lacks inherent uptake and systemic translocation activity. If mites do not come into direct contact with the pesticide solution on leaves, the efficacy cannot be achieved. Controlling the particle size can potentially play a crucial role in the manifestation of efficacy. In this study, high-throughput formulation technology was used to systematically screen a large number of adjuvants to obtain cyetpyrafen formulations. The particle size of the active ingredient in the formulation was measured. By examining the dynamic light scattering and contact angle, we simulated the actual process of the efficacy transmission of cyetpyrafen formulations against Tetranychus cinnabarinus. Our results showed that the activity of cyetpyrafen increases as the particle size decreases, suggesting that reducing the particle size can enhance the coverage and deposition on crop leaves, and further improve the dispersion efficiency and enhance spreading capabilities. Furthermore, controlling the particle size at $1 6 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ resulted in an $\\mathrm { L C } _ { 5 0 }$ value of 0.2026, which is approximately double than that of the commercial product. As a novel pesticide for mites, our study presents the most effective cyetpyrafen formulation in practice. Our findings provide valuable insights into controlling other mite species that pose a threat to agricultural products."

    "abstract": "Potential dermal exposure measurements of horticultural and floricultural field operators that handled concentrated pesticides showed a correlation with the types of formulations used (liquid or solid) during the mix and load stage. For liquid formulations, hand exposure was 22–62 times greater than that for solid ones. The dermal exposure mechanism was studied for this formulation under laboratory conditions, finding that the rupture of the aluminum seal of the pesticide container and the color of the liquid formulation are important factors. Additionally, significant external surface contamination of pesticide containers collected at horticultural farms was found. This could partially account for the differences between the exposure levels of field and laboratory experiments for liquid formulations."

    "abstract": "The concern towards the increasing challenges of sustainable agriculture made the researchers towards significant technological development and innovations in recent years. In particular Nanotechnology offers potential solutions to improve agricultural production assuring sustainability. The incorporation of nanotechnology as a means of nanopesticides delivers the pesticides appropriately i.e., targeted delivery of pesticides by lowering the indiscriminate use of conventional pesticides. The assets of a nanoencapsulated pesticide formulation are controlled releasing properties with enhanced solubility, specificity, permeability and stability. They provide in-built switches to control the release and subsequent availability of pesticides to be used effectively over a given period of time and their design enables them to resist the severe environmental processes such as leaching, evaporation, photolytic hydrolytic and microbial degradation over conventional pesticides. This review provides fundamental information to critically assess the significant role of nanotechnology for encapsulation of pesticides."

    "abstract": "The unreasonable use of chemical pesticides has caused serious damage to crops and the ecological environment. The botanical pesticide matrine has attracted attention as an environmentally friendly pesticide. Compared with traditional spraying methods, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) spraying has the advantages of safety, rapidity, uniform droplets, low dosages, and no terrain or crop restrictions. In this study, matrine OD was prepared according to the application requirements of flight prevention preparations using three different emulsifiers. The stability, wettability, particle size and distribution, and spraying performance of matrine OD were studied. The results indicated that when the amount of emulsifier was $8 \\%$ , the three types of matrine OD had good stability. The stability, wettability, particle size and distribution, and spray performance of the suspension prepared using emulsifier $\\mathrm { V O } / 0 3$ were better than the other two emulsifiers. Therefore, matrine OD prepared using $8 \\%$ VO/03 could be used for ultra-low-volume sprays and aerial applications. In this study, we provide a theoretical basis and technical guidance to develop pesticide formulations for aerial applications."

    "abstract": "Environment pollution related to pesticides has been confirmed by the scientific community for a long time, but the available information on the impact of this phenomenon on human health and the ecosystem are still insufficient. Contamination of the environment can occur through various pathways, ground deposits during the application of pesticides to crops are one of those pathways. The retention rate of sprayed droplets is an important factor both for the efficacy of the phytosanitary treatment and the quantities of lost pesticides on the ground. This paper presents an overview of factors that affect spray droplet behavior, involved process in sprayed drop fate and the mainly techniques for measuring pesticide deposits to the ground and plant retention. We present studies that have focused on pesticide retention and soil deposition during crop spraying in relation to sprayer equipment, used formulation and climatic factors. Plant retention and pesticide deposits during spray is a complex problem depending mainly on physical sprayer parameters, climatic conditions, spray properties and chemical formulation. By illustrating the large variety of analytical methods during the recently years, it aims to explain that it is always possible to assess the impact of pesticides in all compartments of the environment. The use of concerned molecules and natural collectors is the safest to evaluate the real situation, but the use of tracers and artificial targets is both very reported and safety for the environment."
