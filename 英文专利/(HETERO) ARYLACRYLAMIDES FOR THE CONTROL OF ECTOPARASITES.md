# (HETERO) ARYLACRYLAMIDES FOR THE CONTROL OF ECTOPARASITES

## Abstract

The present invention relates to new compounds of formula (I) wherein the variables have the meaning as indicated in the claims; in free form and in salt form; and optionally the enantiomers and geometrical isomers thereof. The compounds of formula (I) are useful in the control of parasites, in particular ectoparasites, in and on vertebrates.

## Background

PCT Patent Publication WO 2011/054436 discloses cinnamides of Formula (A) as plant insecticides
wherein, inter alia, R1 is halogen and A-Y may represent heteroaryl or a variety of different side chains. The compounds are mainly used in the control of invertebrate pests in agronomic environments. Many products are commercially available for these purposes, but the need continues for new compounds that are more effective, less costly, less toxic, environmentally safer or have different modes of action. It now has been surprisingly found that novel derivatives with a modified heterocyclic side chain have superior properties in the control of pests.

The compounds of this invention can exist as one or more stereoisomers. The various stereoisomers include enantiomers, diastereomers, atropisomers and geometric isomers. In case the compounds of the formula (I), (la) or (Ib) have a chiral carbon atom, they may have either an (R) or an (S) configuration. The present invention encompasses compounds formula (I), (la) or (Ib) both with (S) and with (R) configuration at the particular chiral carbon atoms, which means that the present invention covers the compounds of the general formula (I), (la) and (Ib) in which the carbon atoms in question each independently have an (R) configuration; or have an (S) configuration.
If a plurality of chiral centres are present in the compounds of the formula (I), (la) or (Ib), any desired combinations of the configurations of the chiral centres are possible, which means that (1) one chiral centre may have (R) configuration and the other chiral centre (S) configuration; (2) one chiral centre may have (R) configuration and the other chiral centre (R) configuration; and (3) one chiral centre may have (S) configuration and the other chiral centre (S) configuration.
One skilled in the art will appreciate that one stereoisomer may be more active and/or may exhibit beneficial effects when enriched relative to the other stereoisomer(s) or when separated from the other stereoisomer(s). Additionally, the skilled artisan knows how to separate, enrich, and/or to selectively prepare said stereoisomers. The compounds of the invention may be present as a mixture of stereoisomers, individual stereoisomers, or as an optically active form.
One skilled in the art will appreciate that not all nitrogen containing heterocyclic rings can form N-oxides since the nitrogen requires an available lone pair for oxidation to the oxide; one skilled in the art will recognize those nitrogen containing heterocyclic rings which can form N-oxides. One skilled in the art will also recognize that tertiary amines can form N-oxides. Synthetic methods for the preparation of N-oxides of heterocyclic rings and tertiary amines are very well known by one skilled in the art including the oxidation of heterocyclic rings and tertiary amines with peroxy acids such as peracetic and m-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA), hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides such as t-butyl hydroperoxide, sodium perborate, and dioxiranes such as dimethyl dioxirane These methods for the preparation of N-oxides have been extensively described and reviewed in the literature. The manufacture of suitable S-oxides may be performed in an analogous manner using, for example, the same kind of oxidants as mentioned above for the N-oxides.

One skilled in the art recognizes that because of the environment and under physiological conditions salts of chemical compounds are in equilibrium with their corresponding nonsalt forms, salts share the biological utility of the nonsalt forms. Thus a wide variety of salts of the compounds of formula (I) are useful for control of invertebrate pests (i.e. are veterinarily or agriculturally suitable). The salts of the compounds of formula (I) include acid-addition salts with inorganic or organic acids such as hydrobromic, hydrochloric, nitric, phosphoric, sulfuric, acetic, butyric, fumaric, lactic, maleic, malonic, oxalic, propionic, salicylic, tartaric, 4-toluenesulfonic or valeric acids. When a compound of formula (I) contains an acidic moiety such as a carboxylic acid or phenol, salts also include those formed with organic or inorganic bases such as pyridine, triethylamine or ammonia, or amides, hydrides, hydroxides or carbonates of sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium or barium. Accordingly, the present invention comprises compounds selected from formula (I), N-oxides and veterinary acceptable and agriculturally suitable salts thereof. The compounds of the present invention can also form internal salts.
The present invention also provides pro-drugs of the compounds of the present invention that converts in vivo to the compounds of the present invention. A pro-drug is an active or inactive compound that is modified chemically through in vivo physiological action, such as hydrolysis, metabolism and the like, into a compound of this invention following administration of the prodrug to a subject. Exemplary prodrugs are, e.g., esters of free carboxylic acids and S-acyl and O-acyl derivatives of thiols, alcohols or phenols, wherein acyl has a meaning as defined herein. Preferred are veterinary or pharmaceutically acceptable ester derivatives convertible by solvolysis under physiological conditions to the parent carboxylic acid, e.g., lower alkyl esters, cycloalkyl esters, lower alkenyl esters, benzyl esters, mono- or di-substituted lower alkyl esters, such as the ω-(amino, mono- or di-lower alkylamino, carboxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl)-lower alkyl esters, the α-(lower alkanoyloxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl or di-lower alkylaminocarbonyl)-lower alkyl esters, such as the pivaloyloxymethyl ester and the like conventionally used in the art. In addition, amines have been masked as arylcarbonyloxymethyl substituted derivatives which are cleaved by esterases in vivo releasing the free drug and formaldehyde. Moreover, drugs containing an acidic NH group, such as imidazole, imide, indole and the like, have been masked with N-acyloxymethyl groups. Hydroxy groups have been masked as esters and ethers. EPO 039 051 discloses Mannich-base hydroxamic acid prodrugs, their preparation and use. In view of the close relationship between the compounds, the compounds in the form of their salts and the pro-drugs, any reference to the compounds of the present invention is to be understood as referring also to the corresponding pro-drugs of the compounds of the present invention, as appropriate and expedient.
The compounds of formula (I), (la) or (Ib), wherein W is O, may be prepared, for example, by reacting an amine of formula
with a carboxylic acid or a derivative thereof of formula
wherein R1-R5, R6, R7, T1-T3, Y and n are each as defined above and L1 is, for example OH or halogen.
Concerning the compound of formula (III), it is possible to use an acid halide (e.g. L1=chlorine) in the presence of a base, for example triethylamine or sodium hydroxide. In the alternative, the carboxylic acid (L1=OH) can also be employed, in the presence of a coupling reagent, for example dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and/or additives such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Further suitable coupling reagents are 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)carbodiimide, 1,1′-carbonyl-1H-imidazole or similar compounds. The coupling reagent employed to perform the preparation process may be all those suitable for preparing an ester or amide bond as known from textbooks or organic chemistry. In addition, it is also possible to use mixed anhydrides for the preparation of a compound of formula (I). In this process, it is possible to use different chloroformic esters, for example isobutyl chloroformate, isopropyl chloroformate. It is likewise possible for this purpose to use diethylacetyl chloride, trimethylacetyl chloride and the like.
The compounds of formula (I) in which W is O (oxygen atom) may subsequently be reacted with a thionating reagent to obtain compounds of formula (I) in which W is S (sulphur atom).
An alternative process for preparing the compounds of formula (I) or (la) comprises reacting first of all an amine compound of the above given formula (II) with an acrylic acid derivative of formula
wherein L1 is as defined above, and reacting the resulting acrylamide of formula
further with a compound of formula
L2-Y—C(O)NR7R8 (VI),
wherein Y, R7 and R8 are as defined and L2 is, for example, chlorine, bromine, iodine or triflate, in the presence of a palladium catalyst to obtain compounds of the general formula (I), wherein W is O.
Suitable reaction conditions for the first step, the amide formation, correspond to the reaction conditions specified for the reactions of carboxylic acid derivatives of the formula (III) with amines of the formula (II) above.
Acrylamides of the formula (V) can subsequently be reacted with halogen compounds of the formula (VI) by literature methods in a palladium-catalyzed reaction to give the inventive compounds of the formula (I). The palladium catalyst used may, for example, be palladium acetate in the presence of triphenylphosphine.
Compounds of the formula (I) can also be obtained by converting functional groups from other compounds of the formula (I) by methods known from textbooks of organic chemistry.
The precursor compounds of formulae (II) and (IV) are known and/or commercially available or can be obtained by methods known in the art.
Carboxylic acids of formula (III) where L1 is OH can be synthesized by methods known from the literature. For example, an acid derivatives of the above formula (III) may be obtained by a Heck reaction proceeding from a (het)aryl compound of formula (VI) as mentioned above by reaction with 1-propenoic acid derivatives in the presence of a multitude of palladium catalysts, for example palladium acetate. It is also possible in the same way to use commonly known anilines, which are first converted to the diazonium salt in the presence of a diazotizing reagent, for example sodium nitrite, and then reacted with 1-propenoic acid derivatives in the presence of a palladium catalyst, for example palladium acetate.
The compounds of formula (VI) may be obtained from the corresponding carboxylic acids of formula
L2-Y—C(O)OH (VII)
by reaction with an amine of formula
HNR7R8 (VIII)
in a manner known per se.
The acids of the formula (III) can also be obtained by reaction of aromatic aldehydes with malonic acid. For example, the aldehyde functional group of a compound of formula
wherein Y is as described above and L3 is a leaving group, in particular fluorine, chlorine or bromine, is first of all protected, for example, by converting it to a cyclic acetal, then a suitable side chain —C(O)NR7R8 is introduced by replacing L3 by methods known from textbooks of organic chemistry. Following deprotecting of the aldehyde, the resulting compound of formula
can subsequently be reacted, in analogy to literature methods, with malonic acid in the presence of a nitrogen base, for example piperidine, with decarboxylation to give a compound of formula (III).
The working examples provide further details concerning the synthesis of the compounds of the present invention.

The compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention are notable for their broad activity spectrum and are valuable active ingredients for use in pest control. They are particularly suitable in the control of ectoparasites and to a certain extent also for controlling endoparasites on and in animals and in the hygiene field, whilst being well tolerated by vertebrates such as warm-blooded animals and fishes.
Animals in the context of the invention are understood to include vertebrates. The term vertebrate in this context is understood to comprise, for example fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals including humans. One preferred group of vertebrates according to the invention comprises warm-blooded animals including farm animals, such as cattle, horses, pigs, sheep and goats, poultry such as chickens, turkeys, guinea fowls and geese, fur-bearing animals such as mink, foxes, chinchillas, rabbits and the like, as well as companion animals such as ferrets, guinea pigs, rats, hamster, cats and dogs, and also humans. A further group of preferred vertebrates according to the invention comprises fishes including salmons.
In the context of the present invention, ectoparasites are understood to be in particular insects, acari (mites and ticks), and crustaceans (sea lice). These include insects of the following orders: Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Homoptera, Hemiptera, Heteroptera, Diptera, Dictyoptera, Thysanoptera, Orthoptera, Anoplura, Siphonaptera, Mallophaga, Thysanura, Isoptera, Psocoptera and Hymenoptera. However, the ectoparasites which may be mentioned in particular are those which trouble humans or animals and carry pathogens, for example flies such as Musca domestica, Musca vetustissima, Musca autumnalis, Fannia canicularis, Sarcophaga carnaria, Lucilia cuprina, Lucilia sericata, Hypoderma bovis, Hypoderma lineatum, Chrysomyia chloropyga, Dermatobia hominis, Cochliomyia hominivorax, Gasterophilus intestinalis, Oestrus ovis, biting flies such as Haematobia irritans irritans, Haematobia irritans exigua, Stomoxys calcitrans, horse-flies (Tabanids) with the subfamilies of Tabanidae such as Haematopota spp. (e.g. Haematopota pluvialis) and Tabanus spp, (e.g.Tabanus nigrovittatus) and Chrysopsinae such as Chrysops spp. (e.g. Chrysops caecutiens); Hippoboscids such as Melophagus ovinus (sheep ked); tsetse flies, such as Glossinia spp.; other biting insects like midges, such as Ceratopogonidae (biting midges), Simuliidae (Blackflies), Psychodidae (Sandflies); but also blood-sucking insects, for example mosquitoes, such as Anopheles spp, Aedes spp and Culex spp, fleas, such as Ctenocephalides felis and Ctenocephalides canis (cat and dog fleas), Xenopsylla cheopis, Pulex irritans, Ceratophyllus gallinae, Dermatophilus penetrans, blood-sucking lice (Anoplura) such as Linognathus spp, Haematopinus spp, Solenopotes spp, Pediculus humanis; but also chewing lice (Mallophaga) such as Bovicola (Damalinia) ovis, Bovicola (Damalinia) bovis and other Bovicola spp. Ectoparasites also include members of the order Acarina, such as mites (e.g. Chorioptes bovis, Cheyletiella spp., Dermanyssus gallinae, Ortnithonyssus spp., Demodex canis, Sarcoptes scabiei, Psoroptes ovis and Psorergates spp. and ticks. Known representatives of ticks are, for example, Boophilus, Amblyomma, Anocentor, Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma, Ixodes, Rhipicentor, Margaropus, Rhipicephalus, Argas, Otobius and Ornithodoros and the like, which preferably infest vertebrates, for example warm-blooded animals including farm animals, such as cattle, horses, pigs, sheep and goats, poultry such as chickens, turkeys, guineafowls and geese, fur-bearing animals such as mink, foxes, chinchillas, rabbits and the like, as well as companion animals such as ferrets, guinea pigs, rats, hamster, cats and dogs, but also humans and fishes.
The compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention are also active against all or individual development stages of animal pests showing normal sensitivity, as well as those showing resistance to widely used parasiticides. This is especially true for resistant insects and members of the order Acarina. The insecticidal, ovicidal and/or acaricidal effect of the active substances of the invention can manifest itself directly, i.e. killing the pests either immediately or after some time has elapsed, for example when moulting occurs, or by destroying their eggs, or indirectly, e.g. reducing the number of eggs laid and/or the hatching rate, good efficacy corresponding to a pesticidal rate (mortality) of at least 50 to 60%.
Compounds of the formula (I) can also be used against hygiene pests, especially of the order Diptera of the families Muscidae, Sarcophagidae, Anophilidae and Culicidae; the orders Orthoptera, Dictyoptera (e.g. the family Blattidae (cockroaches), such as Blatella germanica, Blatta orientalis, Periplaneta americana) and Hymenoptera (e.g. the families Formicidae (ants) and Vespidae (wasps).
Surprisingly, the compounds of formula (I) are also effective against ectoparasites of fishes, specially the sub-class of Copepod, e.g. order of Siphonostomatoida, in particular sea lice, whilst being well tolerated by fish.
The compounds of formula (I) can also be used against hygiene pests, especially of the order Diptera of the families Sarcophagidae, Anophilidae and Culicidae; the orders Orthoptera, Dictyoptera (e.g. the family Blattidae) and Hymenoptera (e.g. the family Formicidae).
Compounds of the formula (I) also have sustainable efficacy on parasitic mites and insects of plants. In the case of spider mites of the order Acarina, they are effective against eggs, nymphs and adults of Tetranychidae (Tetranychus spp. and Panonychus spp.).
They have high activity against sucking insects of the order Homoptera, especially against pests of the families Aphididae, Delphacidae, Cicadellidae, Psyllidae, Loccidae, Diaspididae and Eriophydidae (e.g. rust mite on citrus fruits); the orders Hemiptera, Heteroptera and Thysanoptera, and on the plant-eating insects of the orders Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera and Orthoptera
They are similarly suitable as a soil insecticide against pests in the soil.
The compounds of formula (I) are therefore effective against all stages of development of sucking insects and eating insects on crops such as cereals, cotton, rice, maize, soya, potatoes, vegetables, fruit, tobacco, hops, citrus, avocados and other crops.
The compounds of formula I are also effective against plant nematodes of the species Meloidogyne, Heterodera, Pratylenchus, Ditylenchus, Radopholus, Rizoglyphus etc.
Certain compounds of the formula (I) seem to be also effective against certain species of helminths. Helminths are commercially important because they cause serious diseases in mammals and poultry, e.g. in sheep, pigs, goats, cattle, horses, donkeys, camels, dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea-pigs, hamsters, chicken, turkeys, guinea fowls and other farmed birds, as well as exotic birds. Typical nematodes are: Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, Ostertagia, Nematodirus, Cooperia, Ascaris, Bunostonum, Oesophagostonum, Charbertia, Trichuris, Strongylus, Trichonema, Dictyocaulus, Capillaria, Heterakis, Toxocara, Ascaridia, Oxyuris, Ancylostoma, Uncinaria, Toxascaris, Parascaris and Dirofilaria. The trematodes include, in particular, the family of Fasciolideae, especially Fasciola hepatica.

The good pesticidal activity of the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention corresponds to a mortality rate of at least 50-60% of the pests mentioned, more preferably to a mortality rate over 90%, most preferably to 95-100%. The compounds of formula (I) are preferably employed internally and externally in unmodified form or preferably together with the adjuvants conventionally used in the art of formulation and may therefore be processed in a known manner to give, for example, liquid formulations (e.g. spot-on, pour-on, spray-on, emulsions, suspensions, solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, solution concentrates), semi-solid formulations (e.g. creams, ointments, pastes, gels, liposomal preparations) and solid preparations (e.g. food additives tablets including e. g. capsules, powders including soluble powders, granules, or embeddings of the active ingredient in polymeric substances, like implants and microparticles). As with the compositions, the methods of application are selected in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances. The formulation, i.e. preparations containing the active ingredient of formula (I), or combinations of these active ingredients with other active ingredients, and optionally a solid, semi-solid or liquid adjuvant, are produced in a manner known per se, for example by intimately mixing, kneading or dispersing the active ingredients with compositions of excipients, whereby the physiological compatibility of the formulation excipients must be taken into consideration.
The solvents in question may be: alcohols (aliphatic and aromatic), such as benzylalcohol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol or butanol, fatty alcohols, such as oleyl alcohol and glycols and their ethers and esters, such as glycerin, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol ether, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monomethyl or -ethyl ether and butyl dioxytol, carbonates, such as propylene carbonate, ketones, such as cyclohexanone, isophorone or diacetanol alcohol and polyethylene glycols, such as PEG 300. In addition, the compositions may comprise strong polar solvents, such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, dimethyl sulfoxide or dimethylformamide, or water, fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or isopropylpalmitate, vegetable oils, such as rape, castor, coconut, or soybean oil, synthetic mono-, di-, triglycerides like e.g. glyceryl monostearate and medium chain triglycerides and also, if appropriate, silicone oils. The mentioned ingredients may also serve as carrier for particulate application froms.
As ointment base resp. structure building ingredients the following excipients may be used: Petroleum based substances, such as Vaseline or paraffines, bases made from wool fat, like e.g. lanolin or lanolin alcohols, polyethylene glycols like e.g. macrogols and lipid bases like e.g. phospholipids or triglycerids, such as hydrogenated vegetable oils.
The use of emulsifiers, wetting agents and spreading agents may also be required, in general, lecithins like soy lecithin, salts of fatty acids with alkaline earth and alkali metals, alkyl sulfates like sodium cetylstearyl sulphate, cholates, fatty alcohols like cetyl alcohol, sterols like cholestesterol, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters like polysorbate 20, sorbitan fatty acid esters like sorbitan mono laureate, fatty acid esters and fatty alcohol ethers of polyoxyethylene like poloxyl oleyl ether, polyoxypropylene polyoxyethylene block copolymers as e.g. Pluronic™, saccharose esters like saccharose distearate, polyglyceryl fatty acid esters like polyglycerol oleate and fatty acid esters like e.g. ethyl oleate or isopropylmyristate.
The formulations may also include gelifying and stiffening agents, like e.g. polyacrylic acid derivatives, cellulose ethers, polyvinyl alcohols, polyvinylpyrrolidons and fine disperse silicium dioxide.
As polymeric agents with controlled release properties, may be applied derivatives made by e.g. polylactic acid, polylactic coglycolic acid, poly orthoester, polyethylene carbonate, poly anhydrids and starch and PVC based matrices.
The addition of penetration enhancers like ketones, sulfoxides, amides, fatty acid esters and fatty alcohols may be necessary.
Also preservatives like sorbic acid, benzyl alcohol and parabenes, and antioxidants as e.g. alpha tocopherol may be added.
The active ingredient or combinations of the active ingredient may also applied in capsules, like hard gelatine capsules or soft capsules.
The binders for tablets and boli may be chemically modified polymeric natural substances that are soluble in water or in alcohol, such as starch, cellulose or protein derivatives (e.g. methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, ethylhydroxyethyl cellulose, proteins such as zein, gelatin and the like), as well as synthetic polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone etc. The tablets also contain fillers (e.g. starch, microcrystalline cellulose, sugar, lactose etc.), lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate), glidants (e.g. colloidal silicon dioxide) and disintegrants (e.g. cellulose derivatives) and acid resistant coatings, like e.g. acrylic acid esters.
The compounds of formula (I) according to the invention may be used alone or in combination with other biocides. They may be combined with pesticides having the same sphere of activity e.g. to increase activity, or with substances having another sphere of activity e.g. to broaden the range of activity. It can also be sensible to add so-called repellents. For example, in case of a compound of formula (I) having a particular efficacy as adulticide, i.e. since it is effective in particular against the adult stage of the target parasites, the addition of a pesticide which instead attack the juvenile stages of the parasites may be very advantageous, or vice versa. In this way, the greatest part of those parasites that produce great economic damage will be covered. Moreover, this action will contribute substantially to avoiding the formation of resistance. Many combinations may also lead to synergistic effects, i.e. the total amount of active ingredient can be reduced, which is desirable from an ecological point of view. Preferred groups of combination partners and especially preferred combination partners are named in the following, whereby combinations may contain one or more of these partners in addition to a compound of formula (I).
Suitable partners in the mixture may be biocides, e.g. the insecticides and acaricides with a varying mechanism of activity, which are named in the following and have been known to the person skilled in the art for a long time, e.g. chitin synthesis inhibitors, growth regulators; active ingredients which act as juvenile hormones; active ingredients which act as adulticides; broad-band insecticides, broad-band acaricides and nematicides; and also the well known anthelminthics and insect- and/or acarid-deterring substances, said repellents or detachers. Non-limitative examples of suitable insecticides and acaricides are mentioned in WO 2009/071500, compounds Nos. 1-284 on pages 18-21. Non-limitative examples of suitable anthelminthics are mentioned in WO 2009/071500, compounds (A1)-(A31) on page 21. Non-limitative examples of suitable repellents and detachers are mentioned in WO 2009/071500, compounds (R1)-(R3) on page 21 and 22. Non-limitative examples of suitable synergists are mentioned in WO 2009/071500, compounds (S1)-(S3) on page 22. The said partners in the mixture are best known to specialists in this field. Most are described in various editions of the Pesticide Manual, The British Crop Protection Council, London, and others in the various editions of The Merck Index, Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, New Jersey, USA or in patent literature.

As a consequence of the above details, a further aspect of the present invention relates to a combination preparation for the control of parasites on vertebrates, in particular on warm-blooded animals or on fishes, characterised in that it contains, in addition to a compound of formula (I), at least one further active ingredient having the same or different sphere of activity and at least one physiologically acceptable carrier. The present invention is not restricted to two-fold combinations.
As a rule, the insecticidal and acaricidal compositions according to the invention contain 0.1 to 99% by weight, especially 0.1 to 95% by weight of one or more active ingredients of formula (I), 99.9 to 1% by weight, especially 99.8 to 5% by weight of a solid or liquid admixture, including 0 to 25% by weight, especially 0.1 to 25% by weight of a surfactant. Application of the compositions according to the invention to the animals to be treated may take place topically, perorally, parenterally or subcutaneously, the composition being present, for example, in the form of solutions, emulsions, suspensions, (drenches), powders, tablets, boli, capsules, chewable treats, collars, eartags and pour-on formulations. Preferred topical formulations are understood to refer to a ready-to-use solution in form of a spot-on, pour-on or spray-on formulation often consisting of a dispersion or suspoemulsion or a combination of active ingredient and spreading auxiliaries. The expression spot-on or pour-on method is understood to refer to a ready-to-use concentrate intended to be applied topically and locally on the animal. This sort of formulation is intended to be applied directly to a relatively small area of the animal, preferably on the animal's back and breech or at one or several points along the line of the back and breech. It is applied as a low volume of about 0.05 to 1 ml per kg, preferably about 0.1 ml per kg, with a total volume from 0.1 to 100 ml per animal, preferably limited to a maximum of about 50 ml. However, it goes without saying that the total volume has to be adapted to the animal that is in need of the treatment and will clearly be different, for example, in young cats and in cattle. These pour-on and spot-on formulations are designed to spread all around the animal giving protection or treatment to almost any part of the animal. Even so the administration is carried out by applying a swab or spray of the pour-on or spot-on formulation to a relatively small area of the coat, one observes that from the active substance is dispersed almost automatically over wide areas of the fur owing to the spreading nature of the components in the formulation and assisted by the animal's movements.
Pour-on or spot-on formulations suitably contain carriers, which promote rapid dispersement over the skin surface or in the coat of the host animal, and are generally regarded as spreading oils. Suitable carriers are e.g. oily solutions; alcoholic and isopropanolic solutions such as solutions of 2-octyldodecanol or oleyl alcohol; solutions in esters of monocarboxylic acids, such as isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, lauric acid oxalate, oleic acid oleyl ester, oleic acid decyl ester, hexyl laurate, oleyl oleate, decyl oleate, capric acid esters of saturated fat alcohols of chain length C12-C18; solutions of esters of dicarboxylic acids, such as dibutyl phthalate, diisopropyl isophthalate, adipic acid diisopropyl ester, di-n-butyl adipate or also solutions of esters of aliphatic acids, e.g. glycols. It may be advantageous for a dispersing agent to be additionally present, such as one known from the pharmaceutical or cosmetic industry. Examples are 2-pyrrolidone, 2-(N-alkyl)pyrrolidone, acetone, polyethylene glycol and the ethers and esters thereof, propylene glycol or synthetic triglycerides.
The oily solutions include e.g. vegetable oils such as olive oil, groundnut oil, sesame oil, pine oil, linseed oil or castor oil. The vegetable oils may also be present in epoxidised form. Paraffins and silicone oils may also be used.
A pour-on or spot-on formulation generally contains 1 to 98.9% by weight of a compound of formula (I), 0.1 to 80% by weight of dispersing agent and 1 to 98.9% by weight of solvent. The pour-on or spot-on method is especially advantageous for use on herd animals such as cattle, horses, sheep or pigs, in which it is difficult or time-consuming to treat all the animals orally or by injection. Because of its simplicity, this method can of course also be used for all other animals, including individual domestic animals or pets, and is greatly favoured by the keepers of the animals, as it can often be carried out without the specialist presence of the veterinarian.
Whereas it is preferred to formulate commercial products as concentrates, the end user will often use dilute formulations. However, this depends on the mode of administration. Orally administered products are most often used in diluted form or as feed additives, whereas commercial pour-on and spot-on formulations are normally ready-to-use concentrates. Such compositions may also contain further additives, such as stabilisers, anti-foaming agents, viscosity regulators, binding agents or tackifiers, as well as other active ingredients, in order to achieve special effects.
Insecticidal and acaricidal compositions of this type, which are used by the end user, similarly form a constituent of the present invention.
In each of the processes according to the invention for pest control or in each of the pest control compositions according to the invention, the active ingredients of formula (I) can be used in all of their steric configurations or in mixtures thereof.
The invention also includes a method of prophylactically protecting animals, especially productive livestock, domestic animals and pets, against parasitic helminths, which is characterised in that the active ingredients of formula (I) or the active ingredient formulations prepared therefrom are administered to the animals as an additive to the feed, or to the drinks or also in solid or liquid form, orally or by injection or parenterally. The invention also includes the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention for usage in one of the said processes.
