3-(Trifluoromethyl)pyrazole in an amount of 0.3 g was dissolved in 7 ml of DMF, and 0.11 g of 60% sodium hydride-containing paraffin was added thereto at 0° C. The mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at 0° C. Subsequently, 0.5 g of 2-chloro-3-nitro-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine was added thereto at 0° C. The reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature, and stirred for 30 minutes. The obtained reaction solution was poured into water, and subjected to extraction with ethyl acetate. The obtained organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and subjected to filtration. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. Thereby, a concentrated product was obtained.

[Biological Testing]
The test examples described below demonstrate that the (hetero)aryl sulfonamide compounds of the present invention are useful as the active ingredient in a formulation for controlling harmful organisms. The unit “parts” is based on weight.
(Preparation of Test Emulsion)
Five parts of the (hetero)aryl sulfonamide compound of the present invention, 93.6 parts of dimethylformamide and 1.4 parts of a polyoxyethylene alkyl aryl ether were mixed together and dissolved to obtain an emulsion (I) containing 5% of the active ingredient.
For the control, 93.6 parts of dimethylformamide and 1.4 parts of a polyoxyethylene alkyl aryl ether were mixed together and dissolved to obtain an emulsion (II).
The insect mortality rate and the nematode mortality rate were calculated using the following equations.
Insect mortality rate(%)=(number of dead insects/number of test insects)×100 Nematode mortality rate(%)=(number of dead nematodes/number of test nematodes)×100
Efficacy Test Against Mythimna separata
First, 0.8 g of a commercially-available artificial feed (Insecta LFS, manufactured by Nosan Corporation) and 1 μl of the emulsion (I) were mixed well, and thereby, a test feed was obtained. Subsequently, 0.2 g of the test feed was placed in each of the treatment areas of a plastic test container (volume: 1.4 ml). Subsequently, two second-instar larvae of Mythimna separata were inoculated into each treatment area, and a plastic lid was placed on the test container to prevent the larvae from escaping. The closed container was placed in a thermostatic chamber at 25° C. On the 5th day therefrom, the insect mortality rate and the amount of feed consumed were checked. The test was repeated.
In addition, for a control area, the insect mortality rate and the amount of feed consumed were checked in the same manner as that described in Test Example 1, with the exception of replacing the emulsion (I) with the emulsion (II).
