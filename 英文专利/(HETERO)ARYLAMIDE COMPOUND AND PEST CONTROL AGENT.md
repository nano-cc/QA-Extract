Patent Document 1 discloses a compound represented by Formula (A) or (B) as a compound which is structurally related to the (hetero)arylamide compound of the present invention. These compounds have been shown to be used for an insecticidal or acaricidal agent.
PCT International Publication No. WO 2015/032280
An object of the present invention is to provide a (hetero)arylamide compound having an excellent pest control activity, in particular, excellent insecticidal activity and/or acaricidal activity, and excellent safety, and can be synthesized industrially advantageously; and a pest control agent containing the (hetero)arylamide compound as an active ingredient.
As a result of studies to solve the problems, the present invention including the following aspects has been completed.
(1) A compound represented by Formula (I) or a salt thereof.
In Formula (I), Ar represents a substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C10 aryl group, or a substituted or unsubstituted 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl group, L1 represents a single bond, an oxygen atom, or a sulfur atom, L2 represents a single bond, or a substituted or unsubstituted C1 or C2 alkylene group, X1 represents a cyano group, or a substituted or unsubstituted thiocarbamoyl group, X2 represents a hydrogen atom, a halogeno group, a substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C6 alkyl group, a hydroxyl group, or a substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C6 alkoxy group, X3 represents a halogeno group, a substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C6 alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C6 alkoxy group, or a cyano group, A represents a nitrogen atom or CX4, X4 represents a hydrogen atom, a halogeno group, a substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C6 alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C6 alkoxy group, or a cyano group, R1 represents a hydrogen atom, or a substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C6 alkyl group, R2a represents a substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C6 alkyl group, R2b represents a hydrogen atom, or a substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C6 alkyl group, where R2a and R2b may be combined with each other to form a substituted or unsubstituted C2 to C5 alkylene group, and Y represents a substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C6 alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C10 aryl group, or a substituted or unsubstituted 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl group.
(2) A pest control agent containing at least one selected from the group consisting of the compound according to (1) and a salt thereof as an active ingredient.
(3) An insecticidal or acaricidal agent containing at least one selected from the group consisting of the compound according to (1) and a salt thereof as an active ingredient.
(4) An ectoparasite control or repellent agent containing at least one selected from the group consisting of the compound according to (1) and a salt thereof as an active ingredient.
The (hetero)arylamide compound of the present invention can control pests that cause problems in terms of agricultural crops and hygiene. In particular, the (hetero)arylamide compound can effectively control agricultural pests and acari at a lower concentration. Furthermore, the (hetero)arylamide compound can effectively control ectoparasites that harm humans and livestock.
The (hetero)arylamide compound of the present invention is a compound represented by Formula (I) (hereinafter sometimes referred to as a compound (I)) or a salt of the compound (I).
In the present invention, a term “unsubstituted” means only a group that serves as a mother nucleus. In a case where the group that serves as a mother nucleus is described only with the name without a description of “substituted”, it means an “unsubstituted” group unless otherwise specified.
On the other hand, the term “substituted” means that any hydrogen atom in the group serving as a mother nucleus is substituted with a group (a substituent) having the same structure or a different structure as that of the mother nucleus. Accordingly, the “substituent” is another group bonded to the group serving as a mother nucleus. The number of the substituents may be one or two or more. Two or more substituents may be the same as or different from each other.
The term “C1 to C6” or the like indicates that the number of carbon atoms in the group serving as a mother nucleus is 1 to 6. The number of carbon atoms in the substituent is not included in the number of carbon atoms. For example, an ethoxybutyl group is classified into a C2 alkoxy C4 alkyl group since the group serving as a mother nucleus is a butyl group and the substituent is an ethoxy group.
The “substituent” is chemically acceptable and is not particularly limited as long as it has the effect of the present invention.

The following Test Examples show that the compound of the present invention is useful as an active ingredient of an insecticidal agent, an acaricidal agent, or an ectoparasite control agent.
5 parts by mass of the compound of the present invention, 93.6 parts by mass of dimethylformamide, and 1.4 parts by mass of polyoxyethylene alkylaryl ether were mixed and dissolved to prepare an emulsion (I) containing 5% of an active ingredient.
In addition, 98.6 parts by mass of dimethylformamide and 1.4 parts by mass of polyoxyethylene alkylaryl ether were mixed to prepare a solvent control solution.
The emulsion (I) was diluted with water so that the concentration of the compound of the present invention reached 125 ppm by mass. Maize leaf pieces were immersed in the diluent solution for 30 seconds. These maize leaf pieces were placed in a petri dish, and five second-instar larvae of Mythimna separata were released to prepare an emulsion-treated section.
Similarly, the solvent control solution was diluted with water at the same ratio as that of the emulsion (I), and maize leaf pieces were immersed therein for 30 seconds. These maize leaf pieces were placed in a petri dish, and five second-instar larvae of Mythimna separata were released to prepare a solvent control section.
The petri dishes were left to stand in a thermostatic chamber at a temperature of 25° C. and a humidity of 60% during the test period. Mortality was evaluated at a time of passage of 6 days from the release of the insects, and the insecticidal rate in the emulsion-treated section was calculated, based on the following expression. At the same time, the food consumptions in the emulsion-treated section and the solvent control section were measured. The test was repeated twice.
Insecticidal rate (%)=(Number of dead insects/Number of test insects)×100
The efficacy test against Mythimna separata was carried out for the compounds of Compound Nos. A-27 and A-105. In all compounds, the insecticidal rates were 90% against Mythimna separata and the food consumption was 10% or less in terms of the solvent control section ratio.
The primary leaves of Kidney bean plants were inoculated with 5 adult female Tetranychus kanzawai from Okayama Prefecture. Next, the emulsion (I) was diluted with water so that the compound concentration reached 125 ppm by mass to obtain a drug. This drug was sprayed on the Kidney bean plants and air-dried. The kidney bean seedlings were then placed in a thermostatic chamber with a temperature of 25° C. and humidity of 65%. Mortality of the adult Tetranychus kanzawai was investigated after 10 days had passed from the spraying. The test was repeated twice.
The efficacy test against Tetranychus kanzawai was carried out for the compounds with Compound Nos. shown in Table 5. All of the compounds demonstrated an insecticical rate of 90% or more against Tetranychus kanzawai.

Seedlings of green beans were grown in 3-inch pots, and 8 adult female Tetranychus urticae from Aomori Prefecture were inoculated onto the first leaves. The emulsion (I) was diluted with water so that the concentration of the compound of the present invention reached 125 ppm by mass. The diluent solution was sprayed on the green beans. The green beans were then placed in a thermostatic chamber with a temperature of 25° C. and humidity of 65%. Mortality of the adult Tetranychus kanzawai was investigated after 10 days had passed from the spraying. The test was repeated twice.
The efficacy test against Tetranychus urticae was carried out for the compounds with Compound Nos. shown in Table 6. All of the compounds demonstrated an insecticical rate of 90% or more.
