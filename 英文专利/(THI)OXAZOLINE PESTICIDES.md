The compounds of the invention are valuable active ingredients for use in pest control. The term “pests” includes ectoparasites and endoparasites on and in animals and in the hygiene field. Particular pests are fleas, ticks, mites, flies, worms, and lice. Even more particular pests are fleas and ticks.

Animals in the context of the invention are understood to include vertebrates. The term vertebrate in this context is understood to comprise, for example fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals including humans. One preferred group of vertebrates according to the invention comprises warm-blooded animals including farm animals, such as cattle, horses, pigs, sheep and goats, poultry such as chickens, turkeys, guinea fowls and geese, fur-bearing animals such as mink, foxes, chinchillas, rabbits and the like, as well as companion animals such as ferrets, guinea pigs, rats, hamster, cats and dogs, and also humans. A further group of preferred vertebrates according to the invention comprises fishes including salmons.
In the context of the present invention, ectoparasites are understood to be in particular insects, acari (mites and ticks), and crustaceans (sea lice). These include insects of the following orders: Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Homoptera, Hemiptera, Heteroptera, Diptera, Dictyoptera, Thysanoptera, Orthoptera, Anoplura, Siphonaptera, Mallophaga, Thysanura, Isoptera, Psocoptera and Hymenoptera. However, the ectoparasites which may be mentioned in particular are those which trouble humans or animals and carry pathogens, for example flies such as Musca domestica, Musca vetustissima, Musca autumnalis, Fannia canicularis, Sarcophaga carnaria, Lucilia cuprina, Lucilia sericata, Hypoderma bovis, Hypoderma lineatum, Chrysomyia chloropyga, Dermatobia hominis, Cochliomyia hominivorax, Gasterophilus intestinalis, Oestrus ovis, biting flies such as Haematobia irritans irritans, Haematobia irritans exigua, Stomoxys calcitrans, horse-flies (Tabanids) with the subfamilies of Tabanidae such as Haematopota spp. (e.g. Haematopota pluvialis) and Tabanus spp, (e.g. Tabanus nigrovittatus) and Chrysopsinae such as Chrysops spp. (e.g. Chrysops caecutiens); Hippoboscids such as Melophagus ovinus (sheep ked); tsetse flies, such as Glossinia spp; other biting insects like midges, such as Ceratopogonidae (biting midges), Simuliidae (Blackflies), Psychodidae (Sandflies); but also blood-sucking insects, for example mosquitoes, such as Anopheles spp, Aedes spp and Culex spp, fleas, such as Ctenocephalides felis and Ctenocephalides canis (cat and dog fleas), Xenopsylla cheopis, Pulex irritans, Ceratophyllus gallinae, Dermatophilus penetrans, blood-sucking lice (Anoplura) such as Linognathus spp, Haematopinus spp, Solenopotes spp, Pediculus humanis; but also chewing lice (Mallophaga) such as Bovicola (Damalinia) ovis, Bovicola (Damalinia) bovis and other Bovicola spp. Ectoparasites also include members of the order Acarina, such as mites (e.g. Chorioptes bovis, Cheyletiella spp., Dermanyssus gallinae, Ortnithonyssus spp., Demodex canis, Sarcoptes scabiei, Psoroptes ovis and Psorergates spp. and ticks. Representatives ticks are, for example, Boophilus, Amblyomma, Anocentor, Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma, Ixodes, Rhipicentor, Margaropus, Rhipicephalus, Argas, Otobius and Ornithodoros and the like, which preferably infest vertebrates, for example warm-blooded animals including farm animals, such as cattle, horses, pigs, sheep and goats, poultry such as chickens, turkeys, guinea fowls, and geese, fur-bearing animals such as mink, foxes, chinchillas, rabbits and the like, as well as companion animals such as ferrets, guinea pigs, rats, hamster, cats and dogs, but also humans and fishes.
The compounds of the invention according to the invention are also active against all or individual development stages of animal pests showing normal sensitivity, as well as those showing resistance to widely used parasiticides. This is especially true for resistant insects and members of the order Acarina. The insecticidal, ovicidal and/or acaricidal effect of the active substances of the invention can manifest itself directly, i.e. killing the pests either immediately or after some time has elapsed, for example when moulting occurs, or by destroying their eggs, or indirectly, e.g. reducing the number of eggs laid and/or the hatching rate, good efficacy corresponding to a pesticidal rate (mortality) of at least 50 to 60%.
Compounds of the invention can also be used against hygiene pests, especially of the order Diptera of the families Muscidae, Sarcophagidae, Anophilidae and Culicidae; the orders Orthoptera, Dictyoptera (e.g. the family Blattidae (cockroaches), such as Blatella germanica, Blatta orientalis, Periplaneta americana) and Hymenoptera (e.g. the families Formicidae (ants) and Vespidae (wasps).
The compounds of formula (I) are also effective against ectoparasites of fishes, especially the sub-class of Copepoda (e.g. order of Siphonostomatoida (sea lice), whilst being well tolerated by fish.
The compounds of formula (I) can also be used against worms of the class Cestoda, including the subclasses Eucestoda and Cestodaria.
Compounds of the invention also have sustainable efficacy on parasitic mites and insects of plants. In the case of spider mites of the order Acarina, they are effective against eggs, nymphs and adults of Tetranychidae (Tetranychus spp. and Panonychus spp.).
They have high activity against sucking insects of the order Homoptera, especially against pests of the families Aphididae, Delphacidae, Cicadellidae, Psyllidae, Loccidae, Diaspididae and Eriophydidae (e.g. rust mite on citrus fruits); the orders Hemiptera, Heteroptera and Thysanoptera, and on the plant-eating insects of the orders Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera and Orthoptera
They are similarly suitable as a soil insecticide against pests in the soil.
The compounds of formula (I) are therefore effective against all stages of development of sucking insects and eating insects on crops such as cereals, cotton, rice, maize, soya, potatoes, vegetables, fruit, tobacco, hops, citrus, avocados and other crops.
The compounds of formula I are also effective against plant nematodes of the species Meloidogyne, Heterodera, Pratylenchus, Ditylenchus, Radopholus, Rizoglyphus etc.
The compounds of the invention are effective against helminths. Helminths are commercially important because they cause serious diseases in mammals and poultry, e.g. in sheep, pigs, goats, cattle, horses, donkeys, camels, dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea-pigs, hamsters, chicken, turkeys, guinea fowls and other farmed birds, as well as exotic birds. Typical nematodes are: Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, Ostertagia, Nematodirus, Cooperia, Ascaris, Bunostonum, Oesophagostonum, Charbertia, Trichuris, Strongylus, Trichonema, Dictyocaulus, Capillaria, Heterakis, Toxocara, Ascaridia, Oxyuris, Ancylostoma, Uncinaria, Toxascaris and Parascaris. The trematodes include, in particular, the family of Fasciolideae, especially Fasciola hepatica.
The pesticidal activity of the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention corresponds to a mortality rate of about 50-60% of the pests mentioned, more preferably to a mortality rate over 90%, most preferably to 95-100%. The compounds of formula (I) are preferably employed internally and externally in unmodified form or preferably together with the adjuvants conventionally used in the art of formulation and may therefore be processed in a known manner to give, for example, liquid formulations (e.g. spot-on, pour-on, spray-on, emulsions, suspensions, solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, solution concentrates), semi-solid formulations (e.g. creams, ointments, pastes, gels, liposomal preparations) and solid preparations (e.g. food additives tablets including e. g. capsules, powders including soluble powders, granules, or embeddings of the active ingredient in polymeric substances, like implants and microparticles). As with the compositions, the methods of application are selected in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances.

The compounds of the invention can be administered alone or in the form of a composition. In practice, the compounds of the invention are usually administered in the form of compositions, that is, in admixture with at least one acceptable excipient.

The terms “treating”, “to treat”, “treated”, or “treatment”, include without limitation restraining, slowing, stopping, reducing, ameliorating, reversing the progression or severity of an existing symptom, or preventing a disorder, condition, or disease. For example, an adult heartworm infection would be treated by administering a compound of the invention. A treatment may be applied or administered therapeutically.
The terms “control”, “controlling” or “controlled” refers to include without limitation decreasing, reducing, or ameliorating the risk of a symptom, disorder, condition, or disease, and protecting an animal from a symptom, disorder, condition, or disease. Controlling may refer to therapeutic, prophylactic, or preventative administration. For example, a larvae or immature pest may be asymptomatic but would be controlled by acting on the larvae or immature pest preventing the infection from progressing to a symptomatic or debilitating infection by mature pest.
Thus, the use of the compounds of the invention in the treatment and/or control of pests, in particular helminths, in which the endoparasitic nematodes and trematodes refers to the use of the compounds of the invention to act on the various forms of the pest throughout its life cycle, independent of whether a subject is manifesting a symptom, including morbidity or mortality, and independently of the phase(s) of the challenge.

As used herein, “administering to a subject” includes but is not limited to cutaneous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, mucosal, submucosal, transdermal, oral or intranasal administration. Administration could include injection or topical administration, for example, pour-on or spot-on administration. The pour-on or spot-on method is especially advantageous for use on herd animals such as cattle, horses, sheep or pigs, in which it is difficult or time-consuming to treat all the animals orally or by injection. Because of its simplicity, this method can of course also be used for all other animals, including individual domestic animals or pets, and is greatly favoured by the keepers of the animals, as it can often be carried out without the specialist presence of the veterinarian.
The terms “subject” and “patient” refers includes humans and non-human mammalian animals and fish, the vertebrates described herein, such as dogs, cats, mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, ferrets, cows, horses, sheep, goats, and pigs. Particular subjects are mammalian pets or companion animals, such as dogs and cats and also mice, guinea pigs, ferrets, and rabbits.
The term “effective amount” refers to an amount which gives the desired benefit to the subject and includes administration for both treatment and control. The amount will vary from one individual subject to another and will depend upon a number of factors, including the overall physical condition of the subject and the severity of the underlying cause of the condition to be treated, concomitant treatments, and the amount of compound of the invention used to maintain desired response at a beneficial level.
An effective amount can be readily determined by the attending diagnostician, as one skilled in the art, by the use of known techniques and by observing results obtained under analogous circumstances. In determining the effective amount, the dose, a number of factors are considered by the attending diagnostician, including, but not limited to: the species of patient; its size, age, and general health; the specific condition, disorder, infection, or disease involved; the degree of or involvement or the severity of the condition, disorder, or disease, the response of the individual patient; the particular compound administered; the mode of administration; the bioavailability characteristics of the preparation administered; the dose regimen selected; the use of concomitant medication; and other relevant circumstances. An effective amount of the present invention, the treatment dosage, is expected to range from 0.5 mg to 100 mg. Specific amounts can be determined by the skilled person. Although these dosages are based on a subject having a mass of about 1 kg to about 20 kg, the diagnostician will be able to determine the appropriate dose for a subject whose mass falls outside of this weight range. An effective amount of the present invention, the treatment dosage, is expected to range from 0.1 mg to 10 mg/kg of the subject. The dosing regimen is expected to be monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual administration.
The compounds of the invention may be combined with one or more other active compounds or therapies for the treatment of one or more disorders, diseases or conditions, including the treatment of pests, for which it is indicated. The compounds of the invention may be administered simultaneously, sequentially or separately in combination with one or more compounds or therapies for treating pests and other disorders.
Thus, it is understood that the compositions and methods of the present invention optionally include comprising an effective amount of at least one additional active compound. Additional active compounds useful in the present invention include those used to treat fleas, ticks, flies, and mosquitos and include macrocyclic lactones, like milbemycin oxime, imidacloprid, spinosad, pyriproxyfen, premethrin, S-methoprene, praziquantel and moxidectin.

The activity of the compounds of the invention may be determined by a variety of methods, including in vitro and in vivo methods.
To prepare the test blood mixture for feeding fleas, the test substance is dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide and diluted with citrated cattle blood to the desired concentration. To assemble the test set-up, about 20 unfed adult male and female cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) are placed into a chamber which is closed at the top and bottom with gauze. A metal cylinder is sealed at one end with parafilm membrane, placed with the sealed base onto the chamber, and filled with the test blood mixture, which can be imbibed by the fleas through the parafilm membrane. The blood cylinder part of the assembled test set-up is contained at about 37° C. in an isolated air heated container above the isolating carrier plate holding the flea chambers. The flea chamber part is kept at rt. After 48 h, the insecticidal activity against fleas is determined. 100% means that all of the fleas have been killed or rendered moribund; 0% means that none of the fleas have been affected at the dose administered. From a dose response curve the respective EC50 was calculated (4-parameter logistic curve fitting). A substance shows good insecticidal activity against Ctenocephalides felis if the EC50 is below an application rate of 20 ppm.

In vitro contact tests with ticks are conducted with adult males and females of Rhipicephalus sanguineus. For the coating of the test vials, the test substance is dissolved and diluted in acetone p.a. to the desired concentration. The solution is then homogeneously applied to the inner walls and base of a glass vial by turning and rocking on an orbital shaker until complete evaporation of the solvent. For example, with 900 ppm solution of test substance an area-based dose of 5 μg/cm2 is achieved. After the solvent is completely evaporated, 5-10 adult ticks are applied to each coated test vial, which is then sealed with a perforated plastic lid and incubated in a horizontal position in the dark at rt and ambient humidity. Acaricidal activity is determined after 48 h. For this, ticks are moved to the base of the test vial by gentle knocking, and test vials are then incubated on a hotplate at 45-50° C. for no longer than 5 min. Ticks which remain motionless on the base of the test vial or move uncoordinated without deliberately climbing up to avoid the heat are considered dead or moribund, respectively. An acaricidal activity of 100% means all ticks were dead or moribund. An acaricidal activity of 0% means none of the ticks was found dead or moribund. From a dose response curve the respective EC50 was calculated (4-parameter logistic curve fitting). A substance shows good acaricidal activity against Rhipicephalus sanguineus if the EC50 is below an application rate of 5 μg/cm2.
In this test for example, the following compounds from the preparation examples showed EC50<0.04 μg/cm2: Examples 1.1, 1.11, 1.12 and 1.13.
In this test for example, the following compounds from the preparation examples showed EC50<0.25 μg/cm2: Examples 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.11, 1.12 and 1.13.
In this test for example, the following compounds from the preparation examples showed EC50<5 μg/cm2: Examples 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12 and 1.13.

In vitro contact tests with ticks are conducted with adult males and females of Ctenocephalides felis. For the coating of the test vials, the test substance is dissolved and diluted in acetone p.a. to the desired concentration. The solution is then homogeneously applied to the inner walls and base of a glass vial by turning and rocking on an orbital shaker until complete evaporation of the solvent. For example, with 900 ppm solution of test substance an area-based dose of 5 μg/cm2 is achieved.
After the solvent is completely evaporated, approximately 10 adult fleas are applied to each coated test vial, which is then sealed with a perforated plastic lid and incubated in a horizontal position in the dark at rt and ambient humidity. Insecticidal activity is determined after 48 h. Fleas which remain motionless on the base of the test vial or move uncoordinated without occasionally jumping or walking straight are considered dead or moribund, respectively. An insecticidal activity of 100% means all fleas were dead or moribund. An insecticidal activity of 0% means none of the fleas was affected. From a dose response curve the respective EC50 was calculated (4-parameter logistic curve fitting). A substance shows good insecticidal activity against Ctenocephalides felis if the EC50 is below an application rate of 5 μg/cm2.
In this test for example, the following compounds from the preparation examples showed EC50<0.05 μg/cm2: Examples 1.1, 1.7, 1.11, 1.12 and 1.13.

To prepare the test compound mixture for injecting ticks, the test substance is dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide and diluted with the same solvent to the desired concentration. 1 μl of the test mixture is injected into each abdomen of 5 engorged adult female cattle ticks (Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus). The ticks are individually transferred into the single compartments of 5×5 replica plates and kept in a climate-controlled chamber (28° C., 85% rel. hum.). Acaricidal activity against cattle ticks is assessed after 7 days by assessment of laid fertile eggs. Eggs which do not appear normal may be stored in a climate-controlled cabinet [28° C., 85% rel h.] until larval hatch after 42 days. An acaricidal activity of 100% means that none of the ticks has laid eggs or laid eggs were infertile; 0% means that all the eggs are fertile. From a dose response curve the respective EC50 was calculated (4-parameter logistic curve fitting). A substance shows good systemic acaricidal activity against Rhipicephalus microplus if the EC50 is below an application rate of 10 μg/tick. In this test for example, the following compounds from the preparation examples showed EC50<0.5 μg/tick: Examples 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9 1.11, and 1.13.

In vitro evaluation of contact activity against larval cattle ticks
This in vitro contact tests are conducted with larvae of Rhipicephalus microplus. For the coating of the test vials, the test substance is dissolved and diluted in acetone p.a. to the desired concentration. The solution is then homogeneously applied to the inner walls and base of a glass vial by turning and rocking on an orbital shaker until complete evaporation of the solvent. For example, with 900 ppm solution of test substance an area-based dose of 5 μg/cm2 is achieved. After the solvent is completely evaporated, 10-20 larval ticks are applied to each coated test vial, which is then sealed with a perforated plastic lid and incubated in a horizontal position in trays that are kept in a climate-controlled chamber (28° C., 85% rel. hum.). Acaricidal activity is determined after 48 h. For this, vials are placed vertically and the natural negative egeotactic behavior of cattle tick larvae is used to evaluate the effects. Tick larvae which remain motionless on the base of the test vial or move uncoordinated without deliberately climbing up are considered dead or moribund, respectively. An acaricidal activity of 100% means all tick larvae were dead or moribund. An acaricidal activity of 0% means none of the tick larvae was affected. From a dose response curve the respective EC50 was calculated (4-parameter logistic curve fitting). A substance shows good acaricidal activity against Rhipicephalus sanguineus if the EC50 is below an application rate of 5 μg/cm2.
