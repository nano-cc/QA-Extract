# Abstract

Herbal medicines have been used for centuries to treat diverse health conditions and are increasingly sought after as people pursue natural, holistic care. Growing global concerns about the safety of herbal formulations, however, demand rigorous evaluation for contaminants such as heavy metals, aflatoxins, pesticides, and microbial pathogens. This study assessed the safety and quality of a polyherbal formulation developed for the management of uterine fibroids. Comprehensive screening included inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for heavy metals (arsenic, lead, mercury, cadmium), liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for aflatoxins, gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) for pesticide residues, and standard microbial assays for total viable counts and pathogenic organisms. Results showed heavy metal and aflatoxin levels within acceptable limits, no detectable pesticide residues, and minimal microbial load with no pathogens. These findings align with WHO and API standards, confirming the formulation’s safety and supporting its suitability for preclinical and clinical evaluation in uterine fibroid management.

# 1 Introduction

Herbal medicines have earned a significant reputation throughout history and across cultures as primary and fundamental treatments for a wide range of health conditions. The origins of herbal medicine date back to the earliest days of human civilization, making it the oldest form of medical practice dedicated to promoting human well-being. Herbal medicine is a broad term encompassing a variety of treatments used alongside both conventional and alternative therapies. The approaches employed in herbal medicine are entirely distinct from those in modern conventional medicine. The historical roots of herbal medicine can be traced to ethnopharmacology, a term coined in 1967, which focuses on the scientific study of traditional medicinal plants [1]. Medicinal plants contain a variety of chemical compounds, including primary and secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenols. These plants and their extracts are generally used as therapeutic agents. Over $5 0 \%$ of drugs in the Western pharmacopoeia are either directly derived from herbs or developed through modifications of plant-based compounds [2]. The importance of traditional medicinal systems is underscored by recent studies showing that $7 5 \mathrm { - } 9 0 \%$ of people in developing countries rely on herbal medicines for primary healthcare and other medical needs [3, 4].

Uterine fibroids are common non-cancerous tumors that develop in or around the uterus, affecting many women of reproductive age [5]. Various genetic, biological, and hormonal factors contribute to the development and growth of fibroids, which are particularly prevalent among Black women [6, 7]. Pharmacological interventions for fibroids include long-term use of GnRH agonists, combined oral contraceptives, levonorgestrelreleasing intrauterine systems, selective progesterone receptor modulators, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and NSAIDs. While these treatments show promising long-term efficacy, their extensive side effects limit clinical use. Hysterectomy remains the most definitive management for leiomyoma, but it carries a higher risk of adverse outcomes. Consequently, there is a significant demand for alternatives to surgical intervention, particularly for women who wish to preserve fertility. Many patients with uterine fibroids are therefore turning to natural remedies and complementary and alternative medicine for safer treatment options [8]. Evaluating the effectiveness of these therapies is crucial.

In the Unani system of medicine, the treatment of fibroid uterus (Usool-e-Ilaj) emphasizes the use of drugs with anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antioxidant properties [9]. Guided by these principles, a polyherbal formulation was designed, comprising Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Commiphora mukul, Bauhinia variegata, Cuscuta reflexa, Iris ensata, and Trigonella foenum-graecum. These plants were selected based on ethnopharmacological evidence for their antitumor, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and uterinemodulating effects [10, 11].

Despite their therapeutic potential, herbal products may be contaminated with heavy metals, mycotoxins, pesticide residues, or microbial agents during cultivation, harvesting, processing, or storage. Such contaminants can compromise efficacy and pose serious health risks. Therefore, rigorous safety evaluation including chromatographic quantification of toxins, microbiological screening, and adherence to pharmacopoeial limits is essential to validate efficacy claims and ensure consumer protection.

# 2 Materials and methods

# 2.1 Chemicals, reagents and instruments

Heavy metal analysis was performed using an Agilent 7700 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) with standard aqueous solutions of lead, cadmium, and arsenic $( 1 0 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m l } )$ and mercury $( 1 0 ~ \mathrm { \mu g / m l } )$ (Charlau Chemie, Spain). Ultra-pure nitric and hydrochloric acids (Merck, India) were used for digestion. Microbial testing employed soybean–casein agar, Sabouraud agar, Salmonella–Shigella agar, lactose broth, and polysorbate- $^ { 2 0 ~ \mathrm { R } }$ (Himedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India). Aflatoxins were quantified on an Agilent 6470 triple-quadrupole LC-MS/MS with standards aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, G2 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis), Acetonitrile, LC grade methanol (Merck Darmstadt, Germany), Milli-Q water (Millipore Bedford, USA). Pesticide residues were screened on a GC-MS/MS platform. Ancillary equipment included a laboratory incubator, hot-air oven, analytical balance, and standard glassware.

Fig. 1 Components of designed Poly-herbal formulation

# 2.2 Collection of plant material

All crude drugs were procured from licensed traders in Khari Bawli, Delhi, except the stem bark of Cinnamomum zeylanicum (sourced from Sri Lanka). Identity was authenticated by Prof. Wajahat Ali, Department of Botany, AMU, using organoleptic, macroscopic, and microscopic criteria cross-checked with ethnobotanical literature [12–16]. Voucher specimens were deposited in the Ibne Baitar Museum, Department of Ilmul Advia, AMU, with accession numbers recorded for reference (Table 1; Fig. 1)

# 2.3 Preparation of test formulation

Oleo-gum resin of Commiphora mukul was purified according to the method mentioned by Pal et al. and Sangolgi et al. [17, 18]. Other drugs were cleaned to remove soil or extraneous matter, oven-dried, and milled to a fine powder. Each powder was sieved through an 80-mesh screen to ensure uniform particle size. Ingredients were weighed in Unani-recommended proportions [19], blended thoroughly, and stored in an airtight container. Processing followed the Unani Pharmacopoeia of India guidelines [20].

# 2.4 Heavy metal determination

Agilent 7700 ICP-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry) was used to detect heavy metals in the DPHF according to thepreviously reported method with slight modification [21]. This equipment featured a micro-mist nebulizer, quartz spray chamber, torch nickel cone, and a mass spectrometry detector. A closed vessel microwave digestion system was employed for sample preparation, and an auto-sampler introduced the digested samples into the ICP-MS. The analysis was performed in helium collision mode using an ORS4 octapole collision/reaction cell, with the system operating under optimized auto-tune conditions via MassHunter 4.4 software.

# 2.4.1 Preparation of standard solutions for calibration

Pipetting precisely $1 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of $1 0 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m l }$ standard reference solutions for lead, cadmium, and arsenic into individual $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ volumetric flasks, they were then diluted to volume using $5 \%$ nitric acid made in Milli-Q water. For mercury, $1 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of a $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g / m l }$ reference standard was placed in a $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ volumetric flask and diluted to volume using a mixture of $3 \%$ nitric acid and $2 \%$ hydrochloric acid in Milli-Q water. These stock solutions were used to prepare calibration curves and stored under appropriate conditions. To make calibration standards with lead, cadmium, and arsenic concentrations ranging from 0.1 to $1 0 0 ~ \mu \varrho / \mathrm { L }$ and mercury concentrations ranging from 0.1 to $1 0 ~ \mu \ g / \mathrm { L }$ , aliquots were further diluted with $5 \%$ nitric acid in Milli-Q water.

# 2.4.2 Sample preparation

Heavy metal sample preparation involved three steps: homogenization, digestion, and dilution. For digestion, $0 . 5 0 \pm \ : 0 . 0 1 \mathrm { ~ g ~ }$ of accurately weighed, dried, and homogenized powder from the test formulation was placed in a tightly sealed PTFE vessel with 10.0 mL of concentrated ultra-pure $\mathrm { H N O } _ { 3 }$ . The digestion process, performed in a microwave digester at a constant $1 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { W }$ power, consisted of three stages: Step 1: Temperature increased to $1 1 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ over $2 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ and held for $5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ ; Step 2: Temperature raised to $1 4 5 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ in $1 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ and held for 5 min.; Step 3: Temperature increased to $1 9 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ over $1 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ and held for $1 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ . After cooling to room temperature, the digested samples were diluted with Milli-Q water to $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m L }$ and further filtered, diluted 100 times for analysis. All samples were analysed in duplicate, and averages were calculated [21].

# 2.5 Microbial load determination

The microbial load of the test formulation was analysed using Soya Bean-Casein Agar, Sabouraud Agar, Salmonella Agar, and Shigella Agar, sourced from Himedia Lab, Mumbai, India. The assessment was conducted at AGSS Analytical and Research Lab, New Delhi. Samples were tested in duplicate, and the average results were recorded.

# 2.5.1 Pre-treatment of the test drug

Dilution was used to neutralize or eliminate any antibacterial characteristics in the sample, and the appropriate procedure was used to dissolve the test medicines, depending on their composition. The test sample was diluted using MM1275-500G, a Buffered Sodium Chloride-Peptone Solution, $\mathrm { p H } 7 . 0$ (Himedia Labs, Mumbai, India).

# 2.5.2 A for water soluble substances

Lactose broth (M1003-500G, Himedia Labs, Mumbai, India), which has been demonstrated to have no bacterial activity under the test conditions, unless otherwise noted, was used to dissolve $1 0 \ \mathrm { g }$ of the test drug. The suspension’s $\mathrm { p H }$ was brought down to about 7 and the volume was adjusted to $1 0 0 \mathrm { m l }$ using the same medium.

# 2.5.3 B for Non water soluble substances

$1 0 \ : \mathrm { g }$ of the test material were dissolved in lactose broth, which has been demonstrated to have no antibacterial activity under test conditions, unless otherwise noted. An appropriate Polysorbate 20R surfactant solution containing $1 \mathrm { m g / m l }$ of potassium tellurite was added to aid in dilution. The pH of the suspension was set at about 7, and the total volume was adjusted to $1 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ using the same medium.

# 2.5.4 Test procedure

To ensure even dissemination of the microorganisms, the test formulation was shaken vigorously. For stock preparation, $5 \mathrm { m l }$ of the formulation was mixed with $9 5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of sterile distilled water and subjected to tenfold serial dilution. A $1 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ aliquot of the stock solution was aseptically transferred into $9 \mathrm { m l }$ of sterile distilled water. All media, prepared as per the manufacturer’s instructions, were used for microbial analysis. For bacterial and coliform counts, dilutions were plated with $\sim 1 5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of liquefied casein-soybean digest agar. For fungal counts, $1 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of the test formulation was streaked on Sabouraud glucose agar plates. Bacterial plates were incubated at $3 0 { - } 3 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ for $4 8 \mathrm { - } 7 2 \mathrm { h }$ , while fungal plates were incubated at $2 0 { - } 2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } C$ for 5 days. After incubation, the total bacterial and fungal counts were recorded [22].

# 2.6 Aflatoxin determination

Aflatoxins were determined in test formulation according to QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) method with some modification as described by Sirhan et al. and Ouakhssase et al. [23, 24].

# 2.6.1 Preparation of working solution

Acetonitrile/water $( 5 0 { : } 5 0 , \mathbf { v } / \mathbf { v } )$ was used to dilute the appropriate volumes of individual standard solutions ( $1 2 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ for AFB1 and AFG1, $4 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ for AFB2 and AFG2) to $5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ . This produced an intermediate mixed solution that contained $0 . 0 5 ~ { \mu \mathrm { g / m l } }$ for AFB1 and AFG1, $0 . 0 4 7 \ : \mu \mathrm { g / m l }$ , and $0 . 0 4 5 \ : \mu \mathrm { g / m l }$ for AFB2 and AFG2, respectively.

# 2.6.2 Preparation of solvent calibration curves

5, 10, 15, 20, and $2 5 ~ \mu \mathrm { l }$ aliquots of the intermediate mixed solution were taken and diluted to $1 \ \mathrm { m l }$ with acetonitrile/water $\left( 5 0 { : } 5 0 , { \mathrm { ~ v / v } } \right)$ in order to create the calibration curve in solvent. This resulted in five concentration levels: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, and $1 . 2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / }$ ml for AFB1 and AFG1; 0.235, 0.47, 0.705, 0.94, and $1 . 1 7 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m l }$ for AFB2; and 0.225, 0.45, 0.675, 0.9, and $1 . 1 2 5 ~ \mathrm { n g / m l }$ for AFG2. Amber flasks containing the individual standard solution and the intermediate mixed solution were placed in a freezer at ${ } ^ { - 1 8 } \ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ until they were analysed.

# 2.6.3 Mobile phase and gradient elution

Three distinct mobile phases were tested in the investigation. Eluent A consisted of water, while acetonitrile, methanol, and methanol with $5 ~ \mathrm { m M }$ ammonium acetate were evaluated individually as eluent B. A consistent gradient elution was applied across all three mobile phase types. The proportion of eluent B was gradually increased from $1 0 \%$ to $1 0 0 \%$ over $4 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ , followed by a 2-minute hold at $1 0 0 \%$ . The column was then re-equilibrated with $1 0 \%$ eluent B for $3 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ [24].

# 2.6.4 Instrumentation

A 6470 series Triple Quadrupole LC/MS (Agilent Technologies, Germany) and an Agilent Jetstream electrospray ionization (ESI) source were connected to an Agilent 1290 Infinity II HPLC system, which included a flexible pump, vial sampler, and MCT. A Zorbax Eclipse C-18 column ( $3 \mathrm { m m }$ internal diameter, $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ length, $1 . 8 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ particle size, Agilent Technologies, USA) was used for the chromatographic separation of aflatoxins. With an injection volume of $5 . 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ and a mobile phase flow rate of $0 . 6 ~ \mathrm { m L / m i n }$ , the column oven temperature was kept at $4 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . The following parameters were used to run the ESI interface in positive polarity for MS/MS detection: nebulizer gas pressure of 45 psi, capillary voltage of $3 . 5 \mathrm { k V } ,$ capillary gas flow of $8 ~ \mathrm { L / m i n }$ , source temperature of 300 $^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ , nozzle voltage of $5 0 0 \mathrm { V } ,$ desolvation gas flow of $1 2 ~ \mathrm { L / m i n }$ , and desolvation gas temperature of $4 0 0 ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ . Nitrogen (10–30 psi, $9 9 . 9 9 \%$ purity) was generated by a nitrogen generator and utilized as a nebulizer and desolvation gas in collision-induced dissociation (CID) [24].

# 2.6.5 Sample preparation

$3 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of a $6 0 { : } 4 0 , \mathbf { v } / \mathbf { v }$ methanol-acetonitrile solution were used to extract one gram of the homogenized test material, which was then vortexed for one minute in a $5 0 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ polypropylene tube. After adding anhydrous $\mathrm { M g S O _ { 4 } }$ $( 1 . 3 2 \ { \tt g } )$ and $\mathrm { N a C l }$ $( 0 . 2 5 \ { \tt g } )$ , the tube was shaken for one minute in order to accomplish phase separation. A $0 . 2 \mu \mathrm { m }$ cellulose syringe filter was used to filter $0 . 5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ of the upper organic phase after the mixture had been centrifuged for $5 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ at $4 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { r p m }$ . For analysis, the filtered sample was immediately introduced into the LC-MS/MS [24].

# 2.7 Pesticidal residues estimation

Two grams of sample were extracted with $5 ~ \mathrm { m l }$ ethyl acetate for $2 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ , centrifuged at $1 0 , 0 0 0 \ \mathrm { r p m }$ for $2 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ , and the supernatant $( 1 ~ \mathrm { m l } )$ ) subjected to GC-MS/MS analysis for major organochlorine, organophosphate, pyrethroid, and nitrogen-based pesticide groups [25].

# 2.8 Statistical analysis

All analyses were performed in duplicate. Data are presented as mean $\pm$ standard deviation (SD). Descriptive statistics were calculated with GraphPad Prism 8.0.2.

# 3 Results

Safety screening of the designed polyherbal formulation (DPHF) included heavy metal analysis, microbial load determination, aflatoxin quantification, and pesticide residue evaluation. All results were compared with permissible limits specified by the API and

WHO guidelines. The concentrations of arsenic, lead, mercury, and cadmium detected in the test formulation were within regulatory limits. Detailed values are presented in Table 2. ICP-MS analysis confirmed that all four metals were substantially below their respective maximum allowable concentrations, indicating negligible heavy metal contamination. Microbiological evaluation revealed that total aerobic bacterial and fungal counts were well below the maximum acceptable levels. Table 3 summarizes the findings: Total bacterial count: $5 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 } \pm 5 . 6 5 7 \mathrm { C F U / g }$ (limit: $1 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 5 } \ \mathrm { C F U / g } )$ and Total fungal count: $1 . 1 \times 1 0 ^ { 2 } \pm 1 4 . 1 4 \mathrm { C F U / g }$ (limit: $1 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 3 } \ \mathrm { C F U / g } )$ . Pathogenic organisms including Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas were absent, suggesting adherence to good manufacturing and handling practices. LC-MS/ MS screening of aflatoxins were demonstrated extremely low levels, all below the maximum permissible limits. (Table  4). GC-MS/MS analysis revealed that all targeted pesticide groups including organochlorines, organophosphates, pyrethroids, and nitrogen-based herbicides were below detection limits (Table  5). No residues were present at levels of toxicological concern. Figure  2 illustrates the overall workflow for quality evaluation, from raw material procurement to final safety confirmation. Across all tested parameters, heavy metals, aflatoxins, microbial counts, and pesticide residues were either undetectable or well within WHO/API thresholds, verifying the product’s safety for therapeutic consideration.

This study is significant as it integrates Unani principles with modern scientific safety assessments to validate an alternative treatment for uterine fibroids. Unlike conventional pharmacological treatments that pose side effects, this polyherbal approach offers a potentially safer, fertility-preserving option. Similar studies on Chinese and Ayurvedic herbal medicine have reported positive outcomes in fibroid management, yet many lacked comprehensive contamination screening [56, 57]. By ensuring rigorous safety profiling, this study strengthens the credibility of herbal medicine and bridges the gap between traditional healing and modern quality standards.

# 4 Discussion

Health authorities and professionals have expressed growing concern regarding the quality and safety of herbal medicines, particularly due to contamination by heavy metals, microorganisms, aflatoxins, and pesticide residues. Such contamination not only reduces the therapeutic efficacy of these products but also poses significant health risks to consumers [26]. The term “heavy metals” generally refers to metallic elements with high density that are toxic even at low concentrations. This broad category includes metals and metalloids with an atomic density exceeding $\mathrm { 4 ~ g / c m ^ { 3 } }$ , making them at least five times denser than water. The primary health hazards associated with heavy metals are linked to exposure to lead, cadmium, mercury, and arsenic. Medicinal plants form the basis of various herbal products, including medicines, teas, and oils, which are widely used due to their therapeutic benefits and are often regarded as safer alternatives to conventional allopathic treatments. However, there is increasing concern about the contamination of these herbal products and their ingredients with toxic heavy metals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic [27]. Although certain metals are essential for biological functions, excessive intake can be harmful, reflecting the fundamental principle in toxicology: “the dose makes the poison,” which emphasizes that insufficient intake can lead to deficiencies, whereas excessive intake may cause adverse health effects [28].

Heavy metal contamination is primarily caused by human activities, including mining, industrial operations, construction, agriculture, and improper waste disposal. The extensive use of pesticides and fertilizers further contributes to environmental contamination with metals such as lead, cadmium, mercury, and arsenic. These contaminants persist in soil and water, accumulate in plants and animals, and magnify through the food chain, ultimately posing serious health risks to humans and wildlife. Their persistence,tendency to bioaccumulate, and high toxicity make heavy metals a long-term environmental hazard. Exposure to these metals has been associated with numerous health issues, including impairment of the immune system, disruption of cardiovascular function, adverse effects on fetal development, and neurological, psychiatric, and sensory disorders. The severity of these effects depends on the dose, duration, and chemical form of the metals [29]. Lead, a highly toxic environmental contaminant, disrupts the function of various biomolecules by forming complexes with them. Chronic exposure to lead can cause impaired muscle coordination, gastrointestinal disturbances, brain and kidney damage, hearing and vision deficits, and reproductive disorders [30–32]. Cadmium toxicity is similarly associated with tissue damage [33–35], epigenetic modifications affecting DNA expression [36–38], hypertension [39], diabetes [40, 42], apoptosis [41], and insulin resistance [42, 43, 61, 63]. Arsenic, another hazardous heavy metal, poses substantial public health risks. Both acute and chronic arsenic toxicity interfere with the function of several vital enzymes. Like other heavy metals, arsenic can inhibit enzymes containing sulfhydryl groups, resulting in impaired enzymatic activity. Moreover, arsenic binds to the lipoic acid moiety of pyruvate dehydrogenase, inhibiting its activity, which disrupts the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, ultimately reducing ATP production and causing cellular damage [44]. Arsenic-induced damage to capillary endothelium further increases vascular permeability, leading to vasodilation and potential circulatory collapse [45].

In evaluations of heavy metals, four specific metals arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and lead were detected in test samples within the limits specified by the API and WHO [46,

47]. The arsenic concentration in the test formulation was $0 . 0 8 4 0 0 \pm \ : 0 . 0 0 2 8 2 8$ , while the concentrations of lead, mercury, and cadmium were $0 . 0 6 2 5 0 \pm 0 . 0 0 2 1 2 1$ , $0 . 0 0 3 5 0 \pm$ 0.003536, and $0 . 0 1 0 5 0 \pm 0 . 0 0 2 1 2 1$ , respectively (Table 2). All measured concentrations were significantly below permissible limits. In contrast, some studies have reported heavy metal levels exceeding permissible limits in herbal preparations, indicating a global safety concern and emphasizing the need for strict regulatory measures to prevent severe consumer health impacts [48, 49]. For example, a study in Nigeria analyzing 20 herbal preparations found lead, cadmium, and arsenic in $7 5 \%$ of samples and mercury in $7 0 \%$ at concentrations above safe limits, highlighting the urgent need for interventions to reduce heavy metal exposure [48].

Microbial contamination in herbal products can result from environmental pollution and soil contamination [50]. Plant-based medicines are particularly susceptible to contamination by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can pose significant health risks upon consumption. A study conducted in the USA identified antibiotic-resistant strains such as Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Erwinia spp., Ewingella americana, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in 29 herbal supplements obtained from local retailers [51]. Microbiological analysis of the test formulation (Table 3) revealed that Salmonella, S. aureus, Pseudomonas, and E. coli were not detected, and the total bacterial count was $5 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { 4 } \pm 5 6 5 7 \mathrm { c f u / g }$ , below the maximum permissible limit of 1.0 $\times \ 1 0 ^ { 5 } \mathrm { c f u / g }$ . The fungal count was $1 . 1 \times 1 0 ^ { 2 } \pm 1 4 . 1 4 \mathrm { c f u / g }$ , remaining within the acceptable limit of $1 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { 3 } \ \mathrm { c f u / g }$ . All measured values were well below permissible limits according to API standards. These findings are consistent with previous studies where pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella spp. and Shigella were not isolated from certain herbal preparations [52–54], as observed with DPHF, likely due to good manufacturing practices. Nonetheless, locally formulated herbal mixtures in Nigeria have shown microbial contamination, underlining the need for strict quality control during every stage of herbal preparation [55].

Aflatoxins B1, G1, B2, and G2 (AFB1, AFG1, AFB2, and AFG2) are toxic secondary metabolites produced by fungi, particularly Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus parasiticus, and Aspergillus nomius [56]. Recognized as potent natural carcinogens, aflatoxins primarily target the liver. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies AFB1 as a Group 1 human carcinogen, while AFG1, AFB2, and AFG2 fall under Group 2, indicating their potential carcinogenicity [57]. Aflatoxins are widely distributed in agricultural products such as cereals (rice, maize, sorghum, millet), cassava, nuts, oilseeds (e.g., sesame and sunflower), meat, eggs, dairy products, spices, and animal feeds [58]. Several studies have documented toxigenic fungi and mycotoxins in medicinal plants and herbal products [59]. These toxins may contaminate foods and herbal products at multiple stages, including pre-harvest, post-harvest, storage, and processing, particularly under conditions conducive to Aspergillus growth [60–62]. Post-harvest fungal spoilage can affect processed and stored herbal products, causing discoloration, reduced quality, and diminished therapeutic and commercial value. Furthermore, mycotoxins in contaminated herbal materials can adversely affect the liver, kidneys, nervous and muscular systems, skin, respiratory system, digestive tract, and reproductive organs [63, 64]. In the present study, aflatoxin B1 in test samples was $0 . 0 5 5 \pm 0 . 0 2 1$ , and the total aflatoxin levels were $0 . 0 4 0 \pm \ : 0 . 0 1 4$ (Table 4), both below maximum permissible limits. In contrast, several studies have reported aflatoxin concentrations exceeding permissible limits, highlighting potential health risks. For instance, in Uganda, $6 0 \%$ of herbal products contained AFB1, with $4 0 \%$ exceeding WHO guidelines [65], while in South-Eastern Nigeria, 48 of 57 samples $( 8 4 . 2 1 \% )$ tested positive for aflatoxins [66]. Additionally, Abdullah et al. reported AFB1 contamination in 25 of 31 herbal medicine samples, underscoring the health risks of aflatoxin-contaminated herbal products [67].

Pesticides are chemical substances designed to control pests and are categorized by purpose into insecticides, fungicides, nematocides, herbicides, rodenticides, and other groups [68]. Based on chemical structure, pesticides can be classified into organochlorines (OCPs, e.g., HCH, DDT), organophosphates (OPs, e.g., dichlorvos, malathion, parathion), nitrogen-based compounds (e.g., atrazine, propazine), and plant-derived pesticides (e.g., pyrethroids, rotenoids). Residues of these pesticides, along with their metabolites and degradation products, may remain in plants or soil and serve as significant sources of contamination in herbal medicines. Organochlorines act as central nervous system stimulants, causing symptoms such as tremors, hyperexcitability, and seizures. Though generally less acutely toxic than OPs or carbamates, organochlorines persist in the environment and bioaccumulate in tissues, making them highly hazardous. Overexposure to OPs primarily affects the nervous system, inducing headaches, dizziness, paraesthesia, tremors, lack of coordination, or convulsions. OPs inhibit acetylcholinesterase, causing accumulation of acetylcholine at nerve tissues and effector organs, leading to prolonged cholinergic stimulation. Chronic OP exposure can result in delayed neuropathy as a significant long-term effect [69]. In the present study, pesticide residues were not detected in the test herbal formulation (Table 5), confirming its safety with respect to pesticidal contamination.

Although the current study confirms immediate safety, long-term exposure to trace contaminants necessitates ongoing monitoring to assess potential cumulative toxicity. Periodic re-evaluation is crucial to ensure sustained safety and efficacy. From an environmental perspective, overharvesting medicinal plants threatens biodiversity, while soil and water contamination can compromise herbal purity. Sustainable cultivation practices, including organic farming and bioremediation, can help mitigate these risks. By addressing these challenges, herbal medicine can continue to serve as a trusted and sustainable alternative to conventional therapies, maintaining public confidence while safeguarding human health and the environment.

# 5 Conclusion

Unani Medicine is widely regarded as one of the safest medical systems due to its emphasis on drug purification and detoxification. However, potential contamination from environmental pollutants remains a concern. To ensure the safety of herbal formulations, the World Health Organization (WHO) mandates rigorous evaluations before therapeutic use. This study assessed four key safety parameters namely, heavy metal content, aflatoxins, microbial load, and pesticide residues to evaluate the safety of the test drug. The findings confirmed that heavy metals, including arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and lead, were within permissible limits. Aflatoxins, which are known for their hepatotoxic and carcinogenic potential, were also below the WHO threshold. Microbial contamination, including bacteria, yeast, and molds, remained within acceptable limits, and no pesticide residues were detected. All instrumental methods used for the safety analysis demonstrated accuracy within $1 - 3 \%$ in solution analysis, with minimal interference from other compounds. These methods exhibited excellent precision due to their high sensitivity, very low relative standard deviation indicating consistent repeatability, and ultra-low detection limits, allowing for the easy identification of trace contaminants.

These results confirm that the test drug complies with international safety standards and is suitable for therapeutic use in managing uterine fibroids. By ensuring adherence to global safety standards, this study enhances public confidence in the use of herbal medicines. The findings further support the credibility of Unani formulations as safe and effective alternatives to conventional treatments. As herbal medicine continues to gain popularity, integrating traditional knowledge with modern scientific validation is essential for fostering wider acceptance and trust in natural therapies.

# 6 Future scope

Comprehensive safety studies align herbal medicine with modern scientific standards. This integration promotes evidence-based practice, helps the practitioners to bridge the gap between traditional and modern medicinal systems. Furthermore, by identifying and eliminating potential contaminants, safety profiling reduces the risk of adverse reactions and this improves patient outcomes and fostering long term trust in herbal medicine. When safety is assured, herbal drugs can compete with conventional medicine on a global scale, promoting their wider use and cultural acceptance across diverse populations.

# 7 Study limitation

The study’s limited sample size affects the generalizability of findings across different raw material sources. While immediate toxicological safety was confirmed, long-term risks such as chronic and reproductive toxicity remain unexamined, which is crucial for prolonged herbal treatments. Additionally, clinical efficacy in fibroid management was not assessed, leaving the benefit-risk profile uncertain. Addressing these gaps through large-scale studies and long-term toxicity assessments will strengthen the credibility and integration of herbal medicine into evidence based healthcare.

# 8 Comparative safety analysis

The safety findings of this study align with those of similar herbal formulations used for gynecological conditions. Research on Gui Zhi Fu Ling Wan (Traditional Chinese Medicine) and Ayurvedic formulations like Ashwagandha and Triphala has also demonstrated compliance with WHO safety standards for heavy metals, aflatoxins, and microbial contamination [70, 71]. However, some studies have reported variations in heavy metal content due to differences in raw material sourcing [72].

Unlike certain herbal formulations where heavy metals or microbial contamination exceeded permissible limits [48, 49, 55], the tested polyherbal formulation in this study metall safety parameters, reinforcing its reliability. These findings emphasize the importance of stringent quality control. Future comparative studies assessing long-term toxicity across different herbal formulations will further validate the safety and efficacy of herbal treatments for uterine fibroids.
