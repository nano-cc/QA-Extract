Abstract The rapid reduction in agricultural production caused by various pests and diseases necessitates researching and designing novel, efficient, secure and ecofriendly formulations of pesticides. In agricultural farming, pesticides are used to efficiently manage pests and diseases, resulting in higher food production, reduced food waste, and increased farmer profit. Unfortunately, over $90 \%$ of pesticides drain into the environment and persist in agricultural products, causing environmental pollution, which are major drawbacks of a chemical-based traditional pesticide formulation. In the past few years, nanoemulsion-based pesticides have been developed to be effective, nontoxic, cost-effective, and possess excellent physico-chemical stability and greater biodegradability. For this purpose, there is a great interest in the design of efficient nanoemulsion-based pesticide formulations. Two normally immiscible liquids (water and oil) are combined in these formulations to produce an isotropic system. This chapter discusses various scientific concerns and approaches, including preparation method, composition, characterization, and biological properties pertaining to developing nanoemulsion-based pesticide formulations.

# 1 Introduction

In the upcoming years, ensuring food security and feeding the growing world population will be a major challenge. Pesticides are essential for preventing crop losses and assuring food security [95, 149]. In the upcoming decades, pesticide use will be progressively crucial for resolving food security challenges related to ensuring a sufficient food supply for the expanding global population [32, 133]. Pesticide usage has risen significantly during the previous few decades. An estimated 5.2 billion pounds of pesticides are used annually worldwide [89]. The United Nations Population Division predicts the world population will rise by about $30 \%$ by 2050. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) claims that $80 \%$ of the food required to maintain this development must rise from increased production of present crops [134]. In agriculture, synthetic pesticides, including organochlorides, organophosphates, carbamates, pyrethroids, and neonicotinoids, have been widely used since the 1950s due to their effectiveness and rapidity action, cheapness, and convenience of usage. Around 2.5 million tonnes of pesticides are expected to be employed on crops annually [39]. Current excessive usage of traditional synthetic pesticides poses several threats to human health and the environment [1]. There is a rising interest in developing innovative and effective pesticides with less detrimental ecological impacts than synthetic pesticides [116].

Pesticides are grouped into insecticides, fungicides, nematicides, herbicides, and plant growth regulators based on the types of living organisms they kill. They can be used in sustainable agriculture [121], forestry [113], and non-agricultural purposes [101]. It is well known that the majority of pesticide-active constituents are typically hydrophobic compounds that must be combined with a solvent, an emulsifier, and a dispersant in order to produce an appropriate water-based formulation, such as emulsifiable concentrates (ECs) and wettable powders (WPs), for fumigation [120, 152]. Pesticides are rarely utilized directly in their purified chemical form commercially. Therefore, commercial pesticide formulations can be categorized as solid (granules or powders), liquid (solutions or suspensions), and gaseous (vapors). In addition to solutions and emulsifiable concentrates, microemulsions, oil-in-water emulsions, and soluble concentrates are also considered liquid forms [137].

A nanoemulsion is a mixture of two or more liquids that cannot mix, in which tiny droplets of one liquid are dispersed throughout another liquid [57]. Most nanoemulsions have a milky, opaque, or transparent appearance due to the size of the droplets, which can be between $1 0 { - } 3 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ . Nanoemulsion is sometimes called a miniemulsion, sub-micron emulsion, or ultrafine emulsion due to its size range of $^ { 2 0 - }$ $5 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ [123]. A nanoemulsion has thermodynamic instability but dynamic stability. The formulation of a nanoemulsion involves both high-energy and low-energy processes. Hence, it uses the underlying physico-chemical attributes of the system’s components and is sensitive to the arrangement in which chemicals are blended throughout the formulation [12]. The three primary components of nanoemulsions are oil, water, and surfactant. The system is formed subsequently when the surfactant layer separates the oil and aqueous phase. In a nanoemulsion system, the interfacial tension exerted by surfactants separates two immiscible phases,oil and water phase [33]. Conventional pesticide formulations are typically employed inefficiently due to loss and poor leaf adherence, resulting in significant resource waste and environmental pollution. Nanoemulsions possess tiny droplets, homogeneous distribution, high stability, convenient synthesis, and superior deposition, expansion, and penetration of the pest body and plant foliage surface [126, 152]. Therefore, developing more effective formulation methods for pesticides is being promoted globally [9]. In order to develop efficient nanoemulsion-based pesticides, the appropriate formulation technologies must be developed.

# 2 Components of Nanoemulsion

The outlines of nanoemulsion components are depicted in Fig. 1.

# 2.1 Oil Phase

One of the essential parts of making a nanoemulsion is selecting the appropriate oil for the oily phase. This is because the oil affects how easily the active component dissolves and how easy it is to make a nanoemulsion for a specific purpose. If the pesticide is liquid at room temperature, it may be the only factor in the oil phase. Other suitable environmental solvents such as corn, coconut, olive, peanut, soybean, castor, corn, and sunflower oils could also be used. It may also be essential to combine a liquid pesticide that dissolves in water well with a solvent that does not dissolve in water. This is called a “ripening inhibitor,” It slows the growth of droplets caused by Ostwald ripening, which is the movement of pesticide molecules from small droplets to large droplets when the Laplace pressure is different [22]. Pesticide particles can be suspended in an oil phase, but most suspension concentrates are usually dispersed in water [100]. The low solubility of oil in the solution improves nanoemulsion longevity by acting as a kinetic shield to Ostwald ripening. Ostwald ripening is the net movement of oil from tiny droplets to bigger droplets by continuous phase transport [141]. Because oil has many biological properties, dissolving it in a nanoemulsion could increase its cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and antimicrobial properties against pathogenic microbes. The biological responses of essential oils to infections will be affected by the varying phytochemical compositions of oils [21, 48].

Fig. 1 Components of nanoemulsion

# 2.2 Surfactants

To facilitate the dispersion of all components, the surfactant must reduce the interfacial tension nearest to zero. The classification of surfactants is based on: a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail. In preparing W/O nanoemulsion, surfactants with hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) values between 3 and 6 are desirable, but for the production of O/W nanoemulsion, surfactants with HLB values between 8 and 18 are favourable. Surfactants with an HLB value greater than 20 serve as cosurfactants for reducing surfactant concentrations to an appropriate level and forming microemulsions. The examples of various oils, surfactants, and co-surfactants are listed in Table 1.

Three different types of nanoemulsions can be produced, and they are as follows: water in oil (W/O), oil in water (O/W), and bi-continuous [23] (Fig. 2).

1. W/O Nanoemulsions that consist of water droplets dispersed in a continuous oil environment   
2. O/W Nanoemulsions that consist of oil droplets dispersed in a continuous aqueous environment   
3. Microdomains of oil and water are interspersed throughout the system of bicontinuous nanoemulsions (Devarajan et al. 2011).

O/W nanoemulsions may be further categorized into three varieties based on the surfactants used: neutral O/W nanoemulsion (neutral surfactants are used), cationic O/W nanoemulsion (cationic surfactants are used), and anionic O/W nanoemulsion (anionic surfactants are used). The interaction may be stabilized in all three nanoemulsion categories using the appropriate surfactants and co-surfactants.

Fig. 2 Various types of nanoemulsion

# 3 Types of Nanoemulsion

# 3.1 Microemulsion

Microemulsions are thermodynamically stable systems that develop spontaneously when combining particular kinds and concentrations of surfactant, oil, and water. Microemulsions generally develop via thermodynamic self-assembly; however, nanoemulsions require external shear to separate the droplets. Microemulsions have numerous benefits, including thermodynamic stability, the convenience of preparation, transparency, low viscosity, homogeneity, and high solubility [19, 28]. Microemulsion formulations may provide a variety of benefits for pesticide encapsulation and application: (i) Preparation is simple because no specialist equipment is required (ii) Low environmental pollution (iii) Minimal production expenses because organic solvents are not used (iv) Using water as a solvent reduces the possibility of flammability and explosion and (v) Production of tiny oil droplets ( $1 0 { - } 1 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ in size) with increased permeability and absorption rate [25]. In comparison to nanoemulsion, microemulsion requires a more significant proportion of surfactant.

Pesticide microemulsion, a revolutionary water-based pesticide formulation, provides considerable development potential [49]. Microemulsions are defined by the tiny, homogenous droplets that make up the dispersed phase (less than $1 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ , [153]) which enhance the ability of pesticides to reach their target pests or plants [28]. Although the concentration of the active ingredient in microemulsions is low, the solubilization of the active ingredient and the presence of a large amount of surfactant may elevate the biological activity of the microemulsion. Considerable research on the development and stability of pesticide nanoemulsions have been published in recent years, with an emphasis on the high-energy emulsification method [85] and microemulsion dilution [135] as a method of production, in addition to methyl decanoate [135] and fatty acid methyl ester [84] as solvents.

# 3.2 Emulsifiable Concentrates

Among the many pesticide formulations available, emulsifiable concentrates (ECs) are particularly popular due to their many useful properties. These include strong biological activity, low environmental impact, simple production processes, and longterm storage stability. Usually, an EC is produced by dissolving a pesticide in a nonpolar solvent, including surfactants. A polar solvent is exploited as a co-solvent if a pesticide is almost insoluble in a typical nonpolar solvent [71]. The following are advantages of emulsifiable concentrates for pesticide applications: (i) minimal apparatus demands, (ii) simple processing demands, (iii) straightforward application, (iv) good storage stability, (v) high amounts of active components, and (vi) highbiological activity [143]. The emulsifiable concentrate formulation is completely biodegradable and somewhat harmless for animals and the environment [140].

# 4 Developments of Nanoemulsions-Based Pesticide

Several researchers have focused on developing more efficient pesticide formulations using nanoemulsions to avoid synthetic pesticides’ shortcomings. The smaller drop sizes of nanoemulsions over traditional emulsions provide the system with enhanced wettability, spreadability, and biocompatibility. Nanoemulsion-based formulations may enhance pesticide characteristics and behaviors such as stability, solubility, mobility, dispersion, and targeted delivery [150]. Consequently, it has the potential to substantially enhance the feasibility, safeness, and economic effects of conventional pesticides by continuing to increase efficacy, extending effect duration, lowering dose demanded, facilitating the managed release of the active ingredients, and enhancing payload consistency in the environment, thereby minimizing run-off and environmental residuals.

# 4.1 Preparation Method of Nanoemulsions-Based Pesticides

Nanoemulsions are metastable systems, and how they are prepared influences the degree to which they are stable [135, 136]. Nanoemulsions lack thermodynamic stability but are kinetically stable. In addition, emulsions are understood to be nanoemulsions if the droplet sizes are measured in the nanometer range. The several nanoemulsion preparation processes include the following two methods: (1) lowenergy emulsification and (2) high-energy emulsification. The high-energy emulsification process consists of high-energy stirring, high-pressure homogenization, ultrasonic emulsification, membrane emulsification, and microfluidization.

Low- and high-energy emulsification can be used to develop nanoemulsions. High-shear mixing, high-pressure homogenizers, high-energy emulsification techniques utilizing ultrasonic generators, and low-energy emulsification techniques utilizing the system’s stored energy are all well known. The hydrophobic insect repellent N, N-diethyl phenylacetamide (DEPA) was emulsified using the low-energy phase inversion temperature (PIT) method [16]. The technique is based on nonionic polyethoxylated emulsifiers’ capacity to alter their hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) values in response to temperature. The HLB decreases with increasing temperature. The ethoxylate unit’s dehydration is the cause of this decline. Therefore, changing the temperature while keeping the composition constant can change the relative affinity of the surfactant for the different phases [13]. The polyethoxylated surfactant hydrates at low temperatures, increasing its affinity for the watery medium.

As a consequence of this, it fosters the development of an O/W macroemulsion that is stable. Dehydration of the polyoxyethylene chain makes the surfactant more lipophilic, which reduces the stability of the O/W emulsion as the temperature rises. This is because of the emulsion’s interaction with the polymer. Surfactant stabilizes W/O emulsions at extremely high temperatures. The nonionic surfactant possesses exceptionally powerful affinities for both immiscible phases at either the PIT or the HLB temperature. The instability of both oil-in-water and water-in-oil macroemulsions in PIT results in a bi-continuous microemulsion structure or layered liquid crystal structure composed of oil, water, and surfactant [13]. As a result, nanoemulsions can be created, supporting the formation of only a few nanometers across emulsions. In order to make nanoemulsions that are kinetically stable through a transitional inversion, the emulsions must first be prepared in a region close to the PIT. Then they must be rapidly cooled or heated.

A W/O emulsion can change into an O/W emulsion due to the rapid cooling after an emulsion is formed in the PIT zone. During a process known as reversed phase inversion, an O/W emulsion can be transformed into a W/O emulsion by rapidly raising the temperature. Fast temperature increases, or decreases of about $2 5 { - } 3 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ are required to create kinetically stable W/O or O/W nanoemulsions, respectively. If this is not done, the resulting emulsions will be lumpy and difficult to work with [8]. The emulsion inversion point (EIP) method is another low-energy technique for creating nanoemulsions [117]. In this instance, unlike the PIT method, a change in composition rather than a change in temperature initiates the phase reversal. Adding water to an oil-in-water emulsion creates a W/O emulsion, which is stabilized by a hydrophilic surfactant with a greater affinity for the water phase than the oil phase. This method’s primary goal is to produce a continuous oil phase. Emulsions stabilized with a surfactant with a higher affinity for the continuous phase are called “normal emulsions.” When water is first added to an emulsion, it only causes more water droplets to form in the oil-continuous phase of the emulsion. It is possible to permanently transform a W/O emulsion into an O/W emulsion by adding more water than is required to slow the rate at which the oil droplets coalesce [93]. This phase inversion process is called catastrophic phase inversion to differentiate it from the transitional phase reversal between two regular emulsions (CPI). The EIP procedure aims to produce pyrethrin-containing O/W nanoemulsions that are kinetically stable. They only detail the creation of micro- and nanoemulsions as encapsulation media using materials that are risk-free and naturally toxic [66]. When conducting an emulsification process, it is possible to reduce the amount of damage done to the environment by employing “green” nonionic surfactants and an oil phase derived from natural sources. The oil phase contained a wide range of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), including hexanoate, octanoate, decanoate, and laureate (methyl hexanoate/octanoate/decanoate/laurate $= 3 . 2 / 5 0 . 8 / 4 4 . 0 / 2 . 0 \ \mathrm { ( w / w ) ) }$ .

Nonionic surfactants such as 3-(3-hydroxypropyl)-heptamethyltrisiloxane (organosilicon), long-chain alkyl polyglycosides (LAPG), and short-chain alkyl polyglucosides (SAPG) are all eco-friendly options. Pseudo-ternary systems involving FAMEs, water, and surfactants containing $41 \%$ (w/w) glyphosate isopropylamine salt were analyzed using phase diagrams to determine which systems had the potential to form microemulsions. These phase diagrams were applied in various ratios and for each surfactant. Microemulsion-based formulations were created using the study’s findings. Droplets smaller than $2 0 0 \ \mathrm { n m }$ in size were achieved in O/W nanoemulsion glyphosate formulations by diluting the latter with much water (1:200) and mixing at a slow speed $2 0 0 \mathrm { r p m }$ for $5 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ ). By contrasting the prepared glyphosate-loaded nanoemulsions with Roundup, a commercially available glyphosate formulation, their effectiveness in suppressing the narrow-leaf herb Eleusine indica was estimated. The optimal results were obtained with a nano vehicle consisting of $3 . 2 7 \%$ FAMEs oil, $7 4 . 5 8 \%$ water, and $2 2 . 1 5 \%$ 8:2 LAPG: organosilicon surfactant matter. A phytotoxicity study was conducted on weed 7–8 days old. Herbicide was sprayed on the plants. Nine distinct glyphosate concentrations were used. The probit transformation was used to create sigmoidal dose–response curves, linearize them, and determine the effective doses (ED50) for the various treatments. Commercial product doses of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and $1 . 0 0 ~ \mathrm { k g }$ herbicide/ ha were primarily used to determine average weed control rates corresponding to the nanoformulation. The ED50 for the nanoemulsion formulation was less than that of Roundup $\mathrm { 0 . 4 8 \ k g }$ herbicide/ha) at $0 . 4 0 \mathrm { k g }$ . Nanoemulsion formulations also had lower surface tensions, allowing pesticides to penetrate leaves more efficiently and increased wettability compared to commercial products. Oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsions of neem oil-based nano pesticides stabilized with the hydrophilic surfactant Tween 20 were developed and characterized. In experiments, droplets as small as $3 1 . 0 3 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ were produced in nanoemulsions with an oil-to-surfactant ratio of 1:3.The LC50 was calculated to be $1 1 . 7 5 ~ \mathrm { m g / L }$ at a droplet size of $3 1 . 0 3 \ \mathrm { n m }$ , indicating a decreasing trend as droplet size was decreased [10].

# 4.2 Chemical Composition of Pesticide Nanoemulsions

A review of the creation and formulation of pesticide delivery systems based on nanoemulsions is presented. Nanoemulsions of oil in water are examples of colloidal dispersions characterized by their thermodynamic instability. They typically consist of oil droplets emulsified and suspended in water. They are similar to oil-in-water emulsions in this respect, which are also common. Droplets larger than $2 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ are considered part of a conventional emulsion, while droplets smaller than $2 0 0 \mathrm { n m }$ are considered part of a nanoemulsion [94]. Nanoemulsions have some benefits over traditional emulsions because of the tiny size of the droplets in them. These benefits include improved droplet stability, enhanced optical clarity, and an apparent rise in bioactivity. Droplet aggregation and gravitational separation are the other benefits [94]. Thermodynamic stability, not particle size characteristics, distinguishes nanoemulsions from microemulsions. Unlike their microemulsion counterparts, nanoemulsions are notoriously unstable from a thermodynamic standpoint. The kinetic stability of nanoemulsions, however, can be improved over time.

If the oil phase is liquid at room temperature, it might only contain pesticide. However, solid pesticides at room temperature or with high water solubility may need oil phase components added. A suitable solvent can be used to dissolve crystalline pesticides prior to homogenization. The ideal solvent should have a low water solubility, high pesticide solubility, wide availability, good safety characteristics, a reasonable price tag, and low toxicity, among other characteristics. It should also be environmentally friendly and widely accessible. Toluene and xylene are two examples of traditional aromatic solvents [85]. However, more eco-friendly options exist, such as methyl oleate [42]. Other examples of these solvents include methyl decanoate and methyl oleate. In theory, other environmentally friendly solvents like food-grade triglyceride oils could also be utilized. Inhibitors, which are insoluble in water, can be added to liquid pesticides to prevent droplet maturation and the spread of the pesticide molecules [22].

Oil-in-water emulsions are made using various kinds of natural and synthetic emulsifiers. All necessary conditions must be met, including low toxicity and environmental compatibility. These conditions include compatibility with pesticides, solvents, and other ingredients and stability against environmental conditions like temperature changes. Any emulsifier should be able to produce excellent emulsifying performance, which entails tiny oil droplets at low dosage levels. In pesticide nanoemulsions, the primary function of emulsifiers is to rapidly adsorb the oil produced during homogenization onto the droplet surfaces, lowering the interfacial tension and making it easier for further droplet fragmentation to take place [92]. Due to the small droplet size, nanoemulsions form an interfacial layer with a highly curved surface. Since the pressure inside the droplet is greater than the pressure outside, there is a pressure difference between the inner and outer sides of the interface. This differential pressure is called the Laplace pressure (P) [129]. Droplet stabilization is yet another function of emulsifiers in pesticide nanoemulsions. For an emulsifier to be effective during homogenization, it must first form a protective coating around the oil droplets [64]. Emulsifying molecules can accomplish this by creating a significant electrostatic or steric attraction between the oil droplets in the mixture.

Additionally, the colliding droplets can create an impermeable interfacial film that is challenging to separate. For this reason, the stability of nanoemulsions depends significantly on the mechanical strength of the interfacial film [83]. Typically, to prevent oil droplets from coalescing, emulsifier molecules should almost completely encapsulate the oil droplets. Nanoemulsion stability can be improved using small molecular alcohols or mixed emulsifiers to form a composite interfacial film [148].

The most widely used co-emulsifiers are alcohols with a hydrocarbon chain, a small polar head group, and a shorter carbon chain. Using a wide range of physicochemical mechanisms, these molecules can alter the interfacial layer’s optimal curvature, reduce interfacial tension, increase interfacial layer flexibility, and enhance emulsion formation and stability.

Understanding the scientific principles governing nanoemulsion behavior as a function of composition is aided by a discussion of the various nanoemulsion components. For example, an aqueous phase and an oil phase form the basis of a typical nanoemulsion, which is then stabilized by an emulsifier or a surfactant. These phases are separated from one another by an emulsifier. The formation of the nanoemulsion, as well as its stability and the functional characteristics it possesses, are all influenced by the properties of the oleic component. These properties include density, viscosity, the value of the interfacial tension, and the refractive index. Typically, water acts as the polar phase of nanoemulsions, dictating their rheological behavior, interfacial tension, polarity, and ionic strength. The coalescence of oil droplets, flocculation, the gradual increase in average droplet size (Ostwald maturation), and gravity separation and sedimentation are the causes of the nanoemulsion’s breakdown into oil and water [77, 78]. As a result of electrostatic repulsion or steric hindrance, a surfactant that adsorbs oil droplets can prevent oil droplets from coalescing and colliding. By decreasing the IFT between the oil and water phases, oil droplets are stabilized against coalescence and collision [74, 75].

Co-emulsifiers can also be used interchangeably with emulsifiers. Coemulsifiers are molecules of surfactant that can adhere to the surfaces of droplets; however, when used on their own, coemulsifiers cannot stabilize emulsions. In some cases, the formation of an emulsion or its stability can be enhanced by adding a co-emulsifier.

# 4.3 Optimization and Characterization of Nanoemulsion-Based Pesticides

Dynamic light scattering (DLS), small angle neutron scattering (SANS), viscosity, and atomic force microscopy are some of the analytical methods used to characterize nanoemulsions: nanoparticles, extreme transparency, tunable viscosity, robust stability, and other desirable traits (AFM). Using dynamic light scattering (DLS), the size of the droplets in a nanoemulsion can be determined. The physicochemical stability of the nanoemulsion is assessed by measuring the droplet size as a function of time with DLS. The reports state that the DLS method determines the Ostwald ripening rate [142]. The SANS technique is helpful for determining the nanoemulsions’ bulk structure because neutron wavelengths can investigate nanoscale structures [50]. The results from techniques like measuring the conductivity, dielectric properties, and nanoemulsion viscosity are appropriate at the macroscopic level. When the water content is raised, the nanoemulsion appears to have a lower viscosity. When the surfactant and co-surfactant content is reduced, it appears to have a higher viscosity. The viscosity variation aids in assessing the stability of nanoemulsion systems. Conductivity tests monitor the phase inversion phenomenon and establish whether the newly formed nanoemulsions are y/w or w/o in composition [27]. The dielectric properties are measured to assess nanoemulsions’ structural and dynamic properties. Atomic force microscopy can determine the nanoemulsion system’s droplet shape. Nanoemulsion systems are evaluated for their stability through battery stability tests, including centrifugation, freeze–thaw cycles, heating–cooling tests, and tests conducted at room temperature. The duration of stability that nanoemulsion systems can maintain without exhibiting Ostwald maturation, coalescence, creaming, or precipitation is examined in these tests. Consequently, the prepared system’s shelf life is predicted [29].

Preformulation and parametric optimization are two crucial steps in creating agrochemicals based on nanoemulsions. To choose the optimization process’s starting point, these parameters are crucial. After they pass the initial screening, the samples are chosen for chemical and biological characterizations. Establishing the critical micelle concentration (CMC) or the surfactants’ hydrophobicity-limiting concentration (HLB) value is crucial in preformulation. The HLB value indicates the type of nanoemulsions produced, whether O/W, W/O, or some other type. When selfassembly begins, and the addition of surfactant no longer reduces the surface tension, the critical micelle concentration (CMC) value is reached. Fluorescent probe [26], surface plasmon resonance, dye solubility, tensiometry, viscosimetry, calorimetry, and electrical conductivity are just a few of the methods that have been used to determine the CMC value. According to previous studies, the pyrene fluorescent probe is one of the easiest and most accurate ways to determine CMC value. The peak difference method measures the absorbance of dissolved fleas in the systems. According to Lu et al. [88]’s graph of concentration versus absorbance, the CMC value is the intersection of the two line segments [45]. The choice of probe molecules impacts CMC measurement because of their charge and functional groups [62]. Several nanoemulsions with various parameters are created during the optimization process and put through the initial sieving process, which includes a centrifugation experiment, freeze–thaw cycle, heating cooling test, and $2 5 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ room temperature nanoemulsion stability test. The most stable nanoemulsion, which does not experience phase separation for a predetermined time, will be chosen for further characterization. In determining the thermodynamic stability studies, this step is crucial.

Characterizations such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), viscosity, zeta, pH measurement, morphology, biological properties, retention, and contact angle measurement are essential for nanoemulsion-based agrochemical formulations. The most popular method for figuring out the size and distribution of the nanoemulsion is DLS. To achieve maximum effectiveness, the nanoemulsion’s small size is preferred. There were a few factors thought to influence nanoemulsion size. Electrostatic interaction-induced aggregation can lead to unwanted multiple scattering effects, so samples are diluted with deionized water before analysis. The polydispersity index (PDI), which gauges system stability, is another area of interest during measurement. Picking a PDI value of less than 0.5 is considered to have good particle diameter uniformity, making it suitable for agricultural use. This is because this value indicates that the particles have a similar size. To characterize samples using DLS measurement, samples with higher PDI will be discarded due to their polydisperse properties [37, 34].

Measurement of viscosity, zeta, and pH; Using a Zetasizer apparatus, the electrophoretic characteristics of the nanoemulsion, also referred to as the zeta potential, are analyzed. The particle’s pH and the surrounding surface properties establish its zeta, a measure of the nanoemulsion’s stability. As the repulsive forces created by a negative zeta value are greater than the attractive forces between the droplets, coagulation, and coalescence are prevented in a dispersed emulsion. Because the attractive forces are weaker than the repulsive ones, this is the case. Increasing the amount of oil in a system may impact the nanoemulsion’s ability to maintain its stable structure [58]. Most pesticide nanoemulsions exhibit alkaline properties and have a $\mathrm { p H }$ ranging from 5 to 6 [15]. The nanoemulsion’s viscosity was determined with an Ostwald viscometer. Several variables, such as the surfactants employed, the organic phase components, and the oil, can impact the measured viscosity. Since pesticide nanoemulsion is highly water-loaded and, therefore, of the O/W type, its viscosity is relatively low. However, the concentration of the surfactant can alter the nanoemulsion’s viscosity [7].

Nanoemulsion morphology and structure are studied using several types of microscopes like atomic force microscopes (AFMs), transmission electron microscopes (TEMs), and cryogenic field emission scanning electron microscopes (CryoFESEM). Clusters of nano micelles formed during preparation led to the formation of spherical [14] or core–shell-like structures [131] shapes for pesticide nanoemulsions have frequently been reported. When the sample is stored, the study is carried out by either monitoring the appearance of the sample or performing periodic measurements of its physicochemical properties. These measurements may include zeta potential or particle size. A stable system is one in which the sample does not undergo visual changes like phase separation, creaming, flocculation, fusion, or precipitation. Before and after storage, the nanoemulsion’s zeta potential and particle size are measured and compared [52].

Measurements of the attachment and contact angles of the leaves are taken to determine how much liquid pesticide should be applied to each leaf surface. The pesticide’s effectiveness can be improved by improving the nanoemulsion’s adherence to the leaves. Because the active ingredient has low interfacial tension, it allows for effective pesticide dilution on the plant surface. The fact that the nanoemulsion’s contact angle drops as its agrochemical content rises is evidence of this [119]. The effectiveness of pesticide nanoemulsions in combating pathogenic organisms can be investigated through biological studies. Researchers have focused on these plant-damaging organisms (bacteria, fungi, and insects) to eradicate or at least bring them under better control [118]. A nanoemulsion based on peppermint oil can be used as a pesticide because it reduces the biomass of the fungus Alternaria solani, which is responsible for the early blight that affects tomato plants [108]. The garlic oil nanoemulsion had a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of $0 . 2 3 \%$ , which was lower than the value for pure garlic oil. This meant that it was more effective at destroying the proteins in Penicillin italicum.

Insect morphological and histological damage following nanoemulsion treatment has been documented in other studies. They tested the nanoemulsions’ ability to irritate and seriously harm insect pests by penetrating their cuticle. According to SEM, tribolium castaneum exhibits necrosis and blackening due to Pimpinella anisum essential oil nanoemulsions [107]. Since they can significantly impact plant seedlings when used as a growth promoter or seed treatment, nanoemulsions are also regarded as growth promoters. It has been discovered that a nanoemulsion made of saponin and thymol essential oil can inhibit bacterial growth while fostering the growth of soybean plants [79]. The cottonseed plant’s germination process and resistance to fusarium wilt disease were improved by eugol oil nanoemulsion [2]. As a seed stimulant, methylcellulose nanoemulsion caused an 18 and $33 \%$ increase in the length of the shoots and roots of maize seedlings [131]. Nanoemulsions of turmeric improved germination and growth when applied to watermelon seeds [6]. Pectin and neem oil nanoemulsion both show signs of stimulating growth in soybean seeds [125]. Many simulation studies that guide nanoemulsion EOR simulation studies using various simulation tools can be found throughout the emulsion EOR literature. Research and experiments conducted in the last few years are summarized in Table 2.

# 4.4 Accumulation, Dispersion, and Evaporation of Pesticide Nanoemulsions

Surfactant molecules are concentrated at the interface between the pesticide and the water in a nanoemulsion of a pesticide. This results in the pesticide being dispersed in the water as nanoscale droplets. Depending on the amount and kind of surfactant used, nanoemulsions can be put into either kinetically stable or thermodynamically stable. Nanoemulsions with high thermodynamic stability can be made when the concentration of a strong repellent surfactant in the aqueous phase is greater than the critical micelle concentration, and a non-polar pesticide is at least partially soluble in water. These nanoemulsions can be used to combat a variety of pests (CMC). Under these conditions, micelles are globular clusters formed when the nonpolar parts of the surfactant molecules arrange themselves inward and coalesce with one another. The polar parts of the molecules extend outward into the aqueous solution. Micelles can be distinguished by their spherical shape. This aqueous solution’s free energy decreases when a non-polar pesticide is added, resulting in the molecules of the pesticide being directed to diffuse into the micelles. Micelles swell and create tiny droplets in this situation. The surfactant and pesticide content primarily influences these droplets’ size in each droplet and chemical composition [51]. This type of nanoemulsion is believed to be thermodynamically stable because the state of swollen micelles possesses the lowest amount of free energy. As a result, as long as the initial conditions are not altered, these nanoemulsions are stable indefinitely. This also means that emulsions form naturally when the surfactant, pesticide, and water components combine. Kinetic energy barriers or slow mass transport processes may require mechanical agitation or heating in practice [51]. These nanoemulsions are highly beneficial for pesticide formulations due to their high stability and straightforward preparation.

Consequently, there is currently a great deal of different commercial formulations available [132]. However, there are several drawbacks to this kind of nanoemulsion as well. For instance, they are expensive due to the sizeable amount of surfactant needed (typically $20 \%$ by weight of the formulation), and only small amounts of pesticide are added to the micelles [81]. A high surfactant concentration can expose plants to unfavorable phytotoxicity, which is undesirable [67]. In addition, because of their propensity to form micelles, the only appropriate surfactant systems are those with a high level of repulsion. Formulation development is a time-consuming process because the ideal combination of surfactants and co-surfactants varies depending on the pesticide that needs to be emulsified. This causes the ideal combination to change from formulation to formulation [94].

Unlike thermodynamically stable nanoemulsions, kinetically stable nanoemulsions form in environments where surfactant molecule aggregation into micelles is energetically unfavorable (such as with lower concentrations or weakly repellent surfactants). Kinetically stable nanoemulsions are almost entirely insoluble in pesticides. The water, pesticide, and surfactant combine to form a biphasic system at the outset, with the surfactant molecules preferentially accumulating at the pesticidewater interface. The system is subjected to shear (such as mixing), which blocks mixing due to interfacial repulsion. As a result, the pesticide phase becomes fragmented into droplets, and the surfactant coats each droplet. Larger pesticide droplets are stretched as this emulsion degrades further, becoming capillary unstable and fragmenting into smaller droplets. This procedure occurs until nanoscale pesticide droplets form [128]. Due to the nanoemulsion’s higher free energy than the stirred state, these nanoemulsions are thermodynamically unstable.

Consequently, the Ostwald ripening process plays a significant part in separating the droplets from the aqueous phase. Surfactant on the droplet surfaces, however, creates an energy barrier that prevents mixing and slows down these processes. As a result of the fact that the pesticide droplets in the nanoemulsion in this scenario will continue to be dispersed for a sizeable amount of time, it has been determined that they are kinetically stable. This stability can last several years with considerable energy barriers (greater than $2 0 \mathrm { k T } ,$ ), which is sufficient for most practical applications [53]. Due to eliminating the need for micelles, kinetically stable nanoemulsions can be formulated with significantly less surfactant $5 \mathrm { - } 1 0 \%$ by weight of the formulation) than thermodynamically stable nanoemulsions. This is because kinetically stable nanoemulsions do not form micelles. In addition, a broader selection of surfactant systems is available for use [94].

Many processes, such as ultrasonication, high-pressure homogenization, phase transition, and phase inversion temperature, fall into high-energy mixing methods. The coarse emulsion is mixed using the ultrasonication method, which involves using high power and ultrasonic frequencies to stir a vibrating solid surface. Due to cavitations, which are caused when tiny liquid-free bubbles form and burst, the emulsion droplets are broken up by powerful shock waves and fast-moving liquid jets. Because the sound field that is emitted is typically not homogeneous, it is frequently necessary to recirculate the emulsion. This aims to give each droplet the maximum shear rate possible [91]. Even though this method is typically used in laboratories, it is challenging to scale it up to create pesticide nanoemulsions in commercially viable quantities [135, 136]. By utilizing a high-pressure positive displacement pump capable of operating at up to 2000 atmospheres, the emulsion of water, surfactant, and pesticide that has been previously prepared is pushed through rigid microchannels with a width of approximately $1 0 0 \mu \mathrm { m }$ . The emulsion droplets produce very small droplets in the submicron range due to the excessive collisions, hydraulic shear, cavitations, and intense turbulence resulting from this. A homogeneous nanoemulsion is then produced by filtering the bulk emulsion to remove large droplets. It is recommended that the emulsion be prepared using high-volume pesticide fractions and then diluted to boost the emulsification process’s efficacy. Despite the possibility of coupling, more surfactant is added to stop it [87]. This technique is used in the lab and industry to create nanoemulsions [91]. Research in recent years has aimed to develop several low-energy emulsification techniques for dispersing non-polar liquids as nano-sized droplets to avoid the drawbacks associated with mixing with excessive shear. The primary goal of these strategies is to modify the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) or other conditions that affect the solubility of surfactants, such as temperature and composition. To that end, these methods employ various means to promote the formation of droplets on the nanoscale. Compared to high-energy methods, these tend to have lower costs,however, their development is significantly more difficult [11].

Using the temperature-dependent solubility of nonionic surfactants, phase inversion temperature is a low-energy method for reducing the size of pesticide droplets in an emulsion. The emulsion’s phase is altered (especially that of polyethoxylated surfactants) to achieve this. This procedure begins with creating a coarse O/W emulsion with a nonionic surfactant. This step is followed by Stage 2. Heating the emulsion increases the solubility of the nonionic surfactant in the pesticide phase and decreases solubility in the aqueous phase (reducing HLB). The pesticide droplets’ size is also diminished simultaneously (to create more surface area to accommodate the surfactant). At the phase inversion temperature, an O/W emulsion changes into a W/O emulsion, and the surfactant preferentially becomes soluble in the pesticide phase (also abbreviated as PIT). If the temperature rises, the water droplets’ size will continue to grow. The smallest droplet size is reached at temperatures just below the PIT. These minuscule droplets, though, are unstable and coalesce very quickly. Stabilizing the resulting nanoemulsion by rapidly cooling (to temperatures at least 20 degrees below PIT) increases fluid viscosity and decreases the rate at which pesticides diffuse through water. This slows the rate of aggregation and Ostwald ripening [61].

Fig. 3 Diagram of the production process for pesticide formulations based on nanoemulsions that have enhanced their physicochemical and biologic activities [102]

The phase transition method alters the environment to encourage the formation of pesticide droplets just below the temperature of PIT. A surfactant and pesticide are combined first. Then, water is added slowly to dilute the surfactant concentration and increase the ratio of pesticide to water, resulting in a practical solution [44].

The PIT for the emulsion shifts as a result of the gradual shift in composition that occurs while the temperature remains the same in this scenario.

To use the emulsification method (a water-soluble chemical and a pesticide), a mixture of pesticide, surfactant, and co-solvent must be prepared. After contact with water, an O/W nanoemulsion will automatically form independently. While intense fundamental research is still being done on the specific mechanisms these nanoemulsions produce, the “diffusion and envelopment” mechanism is currently the most widely accepted for self-emulsification [96]. There is mixing when this mechanism is set in motion, and the cosolvent diffuses into the aqueous phase, where it takes up some of the pesticides (forming a three-component phase near the interface). This is because the co-solvent continues to diffuse and dilute into the aqueous phase, rendering it incapable of retaining the pesticide in its dissolved state within the tricomponent phase. Thus, this pesticide causes the surfactant to supersaturate and separate from the water as nano-sized droplets, which are then quickly stabilized by the surfactant at the interface [80]. As shown in Fig. 3, nanoformulations’ superior physicochemical and biological activities cause the properties mentioned above [102].

# 4.5 Advantageous of Nanoemulsion-Based Pesticide Formulations

The following benefits have increased interest in the use of nanoemulsion-based pesticides in agricultural farming:

1. Protects against hydrolysis and oxidation in the oil phase of O/W, and the nanoemulsion is impervious to water and air.   
2. A high surfactant concentration is required to keep the microdroplets stable in producing a nanoemulsion.   
3. Enhance the absorption rate in plant foliage.   
4. Increases biodegradability.   
5. Using nanoemulsions to develop lipophilic active-loaded formulations for pest control has significant promise.   
6. The effectiveness of antimicrobial activity against microbial pathogens was changed by putting pesticides into nanoemulsions.   
7. The nanoencapsulation method has the potential to enhance physicochemical qualities and stability by allowing water dispersibility, decreasing volatility, and shielding the substance from the environment.   
8. The composition and concentration of the components used to generate nanoemulsion systems determine the range of flexibility in particle size and stability that may be produced with these agrochemicals.   
9. Most research findings have demonstrated that pesticidal activities perform effectively in nanoemulsion-based formulations.   
10. They have shown low toxicity against humans, mammals, and the environment.

# 5 Biological Properties of Nanoemulsion-Based Pesticides

Using synthetic pesticides is the most favorable method to protect the economically important crop from pests, weeds, plant parasitic nematodes, and fungi. Pesticides include fungicides, insecticides, nematicides, bactericides, and herbicides. Nonetheless, the use of synthetic chemicals is not suitable for the environment and human health. Biopesticides, including plant source-based and biocontrol microorganismbased, are highly desirable and more beneficial for crop protection. Nanomaterials have novel physical, mechanical, and chemical action [73]. Nanoparticles that come in contact with biological substances can receive a protein coating, which is called the corona effect, that results to enhance the interactivity of the nanoparticles with the cells modifying their mechanism of action in biological substances and having the capability to create toxicity [36, 82].

Much research has been put into establishing nano-based non-synthetic pesticides to benefit economic production by raising yield [65].

Nanoemulsions in pesticide formulation prevent plant disease from affecting economically significant crop yield and production. Nanoemulsions act as an agent that carries and transport biologically active metabolites and agrochemicals toward the target pathogen or phyto-pests [43]. The attractive physiochemical property of nanoemulsion is that a tunable nano size has developed a big surface area, enabling the functional mixture’s emergence, uptake, and accumulation to be highly effective than their counterparts [43]. To obtain better kinetic stability [56], slight surface tension, and better wettability for improved leafage adhesion [145] and enhance the dissolution and solubility of imperfectly water-soluble agrochemicals the active ingredients must be incorporated into the nanoemulsion. It can also work as a coating sheet for pesticides, providing ample protection from photodecay [105]. It was determined that antimicrobic nanoemulsions are many sturdy oil-in-water emulsions with nanometer-sized droplets (positively charged) consisting of extensive properties against fungi, bacteria, and viruses [103, 135, 136]. To effectively reduce plant diseases, nanoemulsion should be used for biologically active pesticides. The common pesticides nanoemulsion formulations are functional chemicals that can kill fungi (Fungicides), destroy insects like snails and slugs (insecticides), kill nematodes (nematicides), and kill weeds (herbicides) [102].

# 5.1 Nanoemulsion as Fungicidal Agents

Diaz-Blancas et al. [34] determined the use of the fungicide TBZ (Tebuconazole) as a nanoemulsion formulation for agricultural applications. TBZ consists of average leaching potency into groundwater [34]. It is a long-lasting pesticide with an adsorption constant $\mathrm { K _ { o c } }$ (for organic carbon) range of about 803 and $1 2 5 1 ~ \mathrm { m l / g }$ [98]. The systemic action mechanism of TBZ permits it to be consumed by plant roots and leaves to prevent the formation of ergosterol. This kind of impediment averted the synthesis of pathogens on the cell wall and reduced the germination of germ tubes [90]. [2] characterized and formed Eugenol nanoemulsion antifungal activities using Tween 20 (non-ionic surfactant) with water as a continuous aqueous phase on cotton. In vitro, antifungal assay demarcated that Eugenol nanoemulsion inhibits the growth of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum (which causes Fusarium wilt on important crops). Eugenol can inactivate important enzymes, which act on the cell membrane or interfere with nucleic acid activity [68]. Eugenol also blocks the ergosterol synthesis [30]. Nanoemulsion of Eugenol impedes radial growth and pigmentation, and sporulation of the pathogen [2]. Its mechanism of action is involved in the distortion of fungal mycelia. It has antimicrobial action against variable food-borne microbes [47], fungi toxigenic fungi [97], and phytopathogens [139]. Lemongrass and clove oil-based non-ionic nanoemulsion suppressed the growth and development of the vascular wilt-causing fungal agent Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici [124]. Da Silva et al. [125] demonstrated that Eugenol nanoemulsion could be a secure formulation for use in farming and not cause a depletion of cell viability, DNA damage, and reactive oxygen species production. Also, they did not present ecotoxicity to Folsomia candida.

# 5.2 Nanoemulsion as Nematicidal Agents

Plant parasitic nematodes damage various economically important crops worldwide. It is very difficult to control nematodes; using insecticides is a good tool against them, but it has several negative impacts on living organisms and the environment. Developing an alternative pest management strategy that is equally effective as a synthetic pesticide and remains safe for the environment is essential. The greatest energy technique is characterized by its speed and efficiency in producing nanoemulsion with nano droplet diameters and small size dispersion [46]. Much research demonstrated that monoterpenes (the primary component of essential oils) are potent antibacterial agents in nanoemulsions [4, 5]. The nematicidal activity of a few nanoemulsions of monoterpenes, namely cinnamaldehyde, citral, geraniol, (R)-carvone, and pulegone, highly reduced egg hatching and increased juvenile mortality of root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne javanica [3]. The nematicidal activity of nanoemulsion dramatically impedes root galls, egg masses, and the population of $M .$ . javanica. The mode of action of monoterpenes and essential oils on nematodes is unknown (Abdelrasoul and Habashy 2021). However, many volatile oils have been found to exhibit carcinogenic activity in Drosophila melanogaster by activating octopaminergic receptors and destroying GABA receptors [38, 70]. Monoterpenes nanoemulsion enhances the mechanism of action of defense-related enzymes like polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase in tomato plants inoculated with M. javanica (Abdelrasoul and Habashy 2021). Therefore, monoterpenes nanoemulsion provides resistance against phytonematodes. Nanoemulsion obtained from Citronella oil potentially suppressed the development of the nematode population as effectively as a synthetic carbofuran-killed nematode [35].

# 5.3 Nanoemulsion as Insecticidal Agents

To control pest and insects, the use of pesticides effectively eradicate insects pest but harmful or toxic to the environment. Ecofriendly substances attract much attention as an alternative to pesticides, and plant-derived products can produce defensive action against insecticides. Nanoemulsion obtained from the crude extract of fruits of Manikara subsericea effectively controls the cotton pest known as Dysdercus peruvianus. Essential oils significantly impact several stored grain insects by contact [20] and reacting by ingestion [40]. Nanoemulsion positively affects essential oils by improving their physical stability, bioactivity and water diffusion. The bioactivity and persistence of volatile oil nanoemulsion from Pimpinella anisum provide an innovative strategy for managing Tribolium castaneum, an economically important stored grain pest, and for managing many insects attacking stored products [55]. The fruits of Pimpinella anisum is a rich source of essential oils (Anisi aetheroleum) and proved to have an anti-convulsant, neuroprotective, anti-ulcer and anti-inflammatory response [60]. The chemical composition shows the presence of phenylpropanoids, with (E)-anethole (1-methoxy-4-(prop-1-enyl) benzene), p-anisaldehyde, chavicol and (E)-pseudoisoeugenyl 2-methylbutyrate [59]. The essential oil of $P .$ anisum and (E)-anethole were found to be very effective against larva as well as mature insects [114, 115] and showed fumigant impact on larvae of Lycoriella ingenua [111]. They displayed great efficacy on the Filariasis vector Culex quinquefasciatus [18], and displayed strong contact noxious impact against both sexes of Blattella germanica adults [146]. Aniseed oil-based nanoemulsion of $P .$ anisum provides insecticidal bioactivity. [99] reported that the increased toxicity of garlic oil nanoemulsion might be due to the increase in the emulsion droplet’s surface area, which leads to increased biological action and become more acricidal than normal emulsion. Nanoemulsion of Mentha longifolia oil increases the toxicant effect against Ephestia kuehniella and boosts the oil persistence time [86]. M. longifolia composed pulegone, p-menthan3-one-cis, 1,8-cineol, p-menthan-3-one-trans and $\beta$ -pinene have great insecticidal properties. The ecofriendly nanoemulsion technique can be applied in storage houses to conserve foodstuff from insect damage [86].

# 5.4 Nanoemulsion as Herbicidal Agents

Herbicides are used to control undesirable plants (weeds). For example, Glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] is a non-selective foliage-sprayed herbicide to manage monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds species [122]. Glyphosate plays a major role in preventing the biosynthesis of phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine (aromatic amino acids) by ceasing the shikimate pathway, deactivating 5-enolpyruvyl shikimate-3-phosphate synthase to slow down weed growth [130]. To minimize synthetic herbicides, the essential way is to help penetrate functional ingredients into leafage [63]. Nanoemulsion-based herbicides can increase the bioavailability of glyphosate, as the hydrated herbicide does not absorb, translocate and penetrate well into the waxy sheet of leaves [63]. They examined that green nanoemulsion formulation with water-soluble glyphosate effectively controls Eleusine indica. Natural herbicide nanoemulsion of Satureja hortensis actively eradicated two weed species: Chenopodium album and Amaranthus retroflexus. S. hortensis majorly contains chemical constituents such as $\gamma$ -terpinene and carvacrol, which have herbicidal activity due to their phytotoxic effect [56] (Table 3).

# 6 Conclusion

Nanotechnology facilitates the production of active substances with nanoscale dimensions. Nano-pesticides offer various benefits beyond their mass equivalents, including (i) secure and straightforward management and less toxicity to non-target organisms, (ii) Higher pesticide effectiveness as a result of the regulated release and consistent surface distribution, (iii) reduced pollution and costs attributable to lower pesticide and toxic solvent concentrations. Nanopesticide formulations are regarded as an efficient method of pest control. Nanoemulsion is a feasible nanoformulation that can enhance pesticide formulations’ consistency, water dispersion, and bioactivity because nanoemulsion formulations may promote efficacy and eliminate synthetic pesticides. In the past few years, nanoemulsions have gained widespread popularity as a water-insoluble pesticide delivery technology due to their excellent efficiency, eco-friendliness, and safety.
